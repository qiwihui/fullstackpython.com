[**First Steps with GitPython**](/blog/first-steps-gitpython.html)
is a quick tutorial that shows how to get started using the awesome
[GitPython](https://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library for
programmatically interacting with Git repositories in your Python 
applications. In the spirit of the 
[thank you maintainers](https://github.com/jhund/filterrific/issues/147#issuecomment-341867147) 
issue ticket I wrote about last newsletter, I opened a quick
["non-issue" ticket for the GitPython developers](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/709)
to thank them. Give them a thank you +1 if you've used the project and also 
found it useful.

The [**Git**](/git.html) page on Full Stack
Python has also just been updated with new resources. A few of my favorite
new tutorials list on the [Git page](/git.html) 
are:

* [Flight rules for Git](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules)
* [Git back to the future](https://philna.sh/blog/2017/01/04/git-back-to-the-future/)
* [Shadows Of The Past: Analysis Of Git Repositories](https://jqassistant.org/shadows-of-the-past-analysis-of-git-repositories/)
* [The anatomy of a Git commit](https://blog.thoughtram.io/git/2014/11/18/the-anatomy-of-a-git-commit.html)

I also split out the Git page resources into beginner, more advanced, specific
use case and workflow sections so it's easier to parse based on whether you're
a Git veteran or still up-and-coming in that area of your development skills.
