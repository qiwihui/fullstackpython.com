   <h1>简介</h1>
<p>你想深入学习 <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> 编程语言。你对语法已经驾轻就熟了。
有好几次，当在学习条件语句、for 循环、类以及玩转开源库（正是这些库让 Python 变得如此强大）时，
你突然领悟到了它的精义。</p>
<p>现在你想用<a href="/learning-programming.html">刚学习的 Python 知识</a>来做一个真正的应用，
一个可以在网上展示，或者能为他人提供服务的应用。 那么你算来对地方了，<a href="/table-of-contents.html">全栈 Python</a> 
就是这样一个网站，在这里你能学到如何<a href="/web-development.html">创建</a>、<a href="/deployment.html">部署</a>
并且<a href="/devops.html">运维</a> Python 项目的一切知识。</p>
   <h1>学习编程</h1>
<p>学习如何编程就是理解如何将想法转换成源代码，再在计算机上运行以实现一个或多个目标。</p>
<p>学习如何编程，包含很多个步骤：</p>
<ol>
<li>设置<a href="/development-environments.html">开发环境</a></li>
<li>选择一门编程语言，例如 Python</li>
<li>掌握本语言的语法和命令</li>
<li>写代码时，通常要用到
   <a href="/application-dependencies.html">第三方库</a> 和
   <a href="/web-frameworks.html">框架</a></li>
<li>运行程序</li>
<li>调试错误和异常结果</li>
<li>为目标用户<a href="/deployment.html">部署</a>并运行应用</li>
</ol>
<h3>我怎样才能学好编程呢？</h3>
<p>关于应该如何开始学习编程存在好几种思想学派。
有一种思想学派认为像 Assembly 或 C 语言等低级编程语言最适合作为启蒙语言，因为它们要求
新手们编写他们自己的数据结构，学习指针，并且经常要求自行解决计算机科学中的难题。</p>
<p>当然这种“低层优先”的哲学存在些许合理性，因为它迫使初学者在移到像 Web 和移动应用开发等
更高级的主题前先牢固掌握好基础知识。这种哲学理念通常在大学计算机科学教学计划中使用。</p>
<p>“低层优先“型方法的学习过程分为</p>
<ol>
<li>理解编程语言的各个特性（类型系统、语法）</li>
<li>编写并且能够使用多种数据结构（堆栈、队列）</li>
<li>掌握常用算法（快速排序、二分查找）</li>
</ol>
<p>另一种思想学派认为新手们应该通过参与实际项目来提升自己，项目可以是
用任何编程语言编写的，关键是要能足够引起他们的兴趣以使他们能坚持
解决那些不可避免会出现的难题。</p>
<p>在这种”基于项目“的思想流派中，完成的项目数量是进步的基本单元，这些项目扩展了程序员的能力。
要想实现额外的提升，可以通过参与开源项目，和经验丰富的导师一起工作来学习他们如何改善他们自己的项目等途径获得。</p>
<h3>我应该先学 Python 吗？</h3>
<p>在基于项目的方法中，Python 是个不错的选择，因为它有大量 <a href="/best-python-resources.html">免费和低成本的入门资料</a>，
并且很多资料中都能找到可用作进一步开发的例子项目。</p>
<p>需要注意的是，对于一个有抱负的程序员来说， Python 是否是一门不错的首选语言这个问题
是非常主观的，并且这些方法并不相互排斥。Python 在大学中也被广泛用于教学，以便
解译计算机科学中的基本概念，这相较与项目优先的方法，似乎更符合”低层优先“的哲学了。</p>
<p>总之，Python 作为学习编程的首选语言是否适合，取决于你自己的学习风格和感觉。
如果你觉得 Ruby 或者 Java 看起来比 Python 更容易学习，那就选它们吧。
编程语言，以及围绕它们的生态系统，都是人造结构。找到一门看起来符合你个人
风格的语言然后尝试下，要知道无论你选择哪种语言，你都需要投入很多个日日夜夜才能
成为一个合格的软件开发人员。</p>
<h3>练习问题</h3>

   <h1>Python 编程语言</h1>
<p>Python编程语言是一种
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/source/">开源</a>，
<a href="/why-use-python.html">广泛使用</a>的工具，用于创建软件应用程序。</p>
<h2>Python用来做什么？</h2>
<p>Python 经常用于<a href="/web-frameworks.html">构建</a>和<a href="/deployment.html">部署</a><a href="/web-development.html">网络应用</a>和<a href="/application-programming-interfaces.html">网络 API</a>。Python 也可以分析和可视化<a href="/data.html">数据</a>，即使被测试的软件不是用 Python 编写的，Python 也可以<a href="/testing.html">测试软件</a>。</p>
<h2>语言概念</h2>
<p>Python有一些有用的编程语言概念，在其他语言中不常见。 这些概念包括：</p>
<ul>
<li>生成器</li>
<li>推导表达式</li>
<li><a href="/application-dependencies.html">应用依赖</a>通过内置 
  <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0405/">venv</a>（<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.3.html">从 Python 3.3 开始</a>） 
  和 <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0453/">pip</a>（<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html">从 Python 3.4 开始</a>）
  命令管理</li>
</ul>
<h2>生成器</h2>
<p>生成器是一种Python核心语言结构，它允许函数的返回值表现为迭代器。
通过在大量迭代的上下文期间分配和释放内存，生成器可以允许更有效的内存使用。
生成器在<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0255/">PEP255</a> 中定义，
并在2001年的 Python 2.2 中包含在语言中。</p>
<h2>推导表达式</h2>
<p>推导表达式是一种Python语言结构，用于在列表，字典和集合中简明地创建数据。列表推导包含在 Python 2 中，
而字典和集合推导在 Python 3 中引入。</p>
<h2>为什么推导表达式很重要？</h2>
<p>推导表达式是在核心Python数据结构中填充条件数据的更清晰的语法。在没有推导表达式的情况下
创建数据通常涉及具有条件的嵌套循环，这些条件对于代码阅读器来说难以正确评估。</p>
<h2>推导表达式示例</h2>
<p>列表推导：</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt;&gt;&gt; double_digit_evens = [e*2 for e in range(5, 50)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; double_digit_evens
[10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98]
</pre></div>


<p>集合推导：</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt;&gt;&gt; double_digit_odds = {e*2+1 for e in range(5, 50)}
{11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99}
</pre></div>


<p>字典推导：</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt;&gt;&gt; {e: e*10 for e in range(1, 11)}
{1: 10, 2: 20, 3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60, 7: 70, 8: 80, 9: 90, 10: 100}
</pre></div>

   <h1>为什么用 Python？</h1>
<p>Python 有丰富的软件库资源，包括开源数据分析工具、
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">Web 框架</a>、测试工具等，
正是这些库资源使 Python 生态系统成长为最大的编程社区之一。</p>
<p>Python 社区提供了丰富的<a href="/best-python-resources.html">入门资料</a>，
因此对于初学者来说，它是一门相当易学的语言。
Python 在大学里也广泛被用于教学，并且也在像<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">树莓派</a>那样的
对于初学者来说易于上手的设备上使用。</p>
<p><img src="/img/logos/py.png" width="100%" alt="Python logo."></p>
<div class="well see-also">如果你想了解为何要选用 Python，你应该也看下<a href="/best-python-resources.html">最佳 Python 资源</a>和<a href="/what-full-stack-means.html">“全栈”指的是什么</a>。</div>

<h2>Python 编程语言的流行度</h2>
<p>现在有好几种编程语言流行排行榜。
尽管我们可能会指责这些统计不太准确，但是所有的排行榜上都将
Python 列为一门 Top10 的编程语言 -- 如果还未进前五的话。</p>
<p>IEEE 在将 Python 列为<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/the-2017-top-programming-languages">2017年 Top1 的编程语言</a>以及<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2016-top-programming-languages">2016年 Top3 的编程语言</a>后，将 Python 列为<a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2016-top-programming-languages">2018年 Top1 的编程语言</a>。
而 <a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2015/01/14/language-rankings-1-15/">RedMonk 2017年6月排行榜</a>将 Python 列为第 3 名，相比<a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2015/01/14/language-rankings-1-15/">它们两年前的排名</a>提高了1位。</p>
<p>Stack Overflow 的社区创建的问答数据证实了<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/">Python生态系统令人难以置信的增长</a>，
并试图通过他们自己的分析来确定<a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/14/python-growing-quickly/">它为何如此快速地增长</a>。 
在2018年 Stack Overflow 开发人员调查中，数据表明<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#technology-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages">Python是增长最快的主要编程语言</a>，
开发人员选择学习的语言和工具与开发人员专业工作中的使用之间存在密切的一致性。</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html">TIOBE 指数</a>,
一份运营了相当长时间的语言排行榜上，Python 已经升至第4名，之前几年还是第8名。</p>
<p><a href="http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html">编程语言流行指数</a> (PYPL)，
一份基于谷歌趋势上的搜索关键字分析数字的排行榜，将 Python 列为第 2 名。</p>
<p><a href="http://githut.info/">GitHut</a>, 一个Github 语言流行度可视化网站上，总的来说也将 Python 订在第 3 名。</p>
<p>这些排行榜提供了语言流行度的大体度量。
它们不是想作为一种精确测量工具来确切地统计出有多少开发人员使用某种语言。
不过，纵观以上的数据可以看出， Python 一直保持为一门稳定的编程语言，并且
其生态系统也在不断成长。</p>
<h2>为什么编程语言的选择很重要？</h2>
<p>每门编程语言都有自己独特的生态系统、文化和哲学。
如果你的编程方法不遵循你选择的编程语言的哲学，你将很难融入社并且会感到很难学习。</p>
<p>Python 的文化价值体现在<a href="https://github.com/trending?l=python&amp;since=monthly">开源软件活动</a>、
社区在<a href="http://www.pycon.org/">地方性、国内和国际性的事务</a>上的参与度以及
乐与指导初学者等方面。
如果这些价值对你/或者你的组织同样重要，那么 Python 就很适合你。</p>
<p>Python 非常注重语言哲学，这种哲学甚至被嵌入进了语言本身，例如当解译器执行 <code>import this</code> 后
会显示 <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">Python 之禅</a>的内容。</p>

   <h1>Python 2 还是 3?</h1>
<p>Python 编程语言几乎完成了从版本 2 升级到版本 3 的长期过渡。初学者通常会有到底该学哪个版本的问题。
Python 3 最初是在 2008 年发布的，但目前仍不是作为默认版本安装在很多操作系统，比如 macOS 上，
听到这些很令人困惑。然而，随着最终的第 2 版 Python 2.7 正在接近其定于<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-March/152348.html">2020年1月1日</a>的生命周期结束，这种情况正在迅速发生变化。</p>
<p>现在简单的答案是：学习Python 3，特别是截至2018年5月的最新版本是 <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3.6.5</a>。 
如果由于某种原因你绝对必须学习 Python 2，例如因为你的雇主正在研究一堆遗留代码，
你将能够将你的大部分知识从 Python 2 转移到 Python 3 中。同样，你如果从 Python 3 开始，
你仍然能够阅读和编写 Python 2 代码。</p>
<p>有足够的<a href="/best-python-resources.html">很棒的资源</a>可以教你在没有任何先前版本2经验的版本3中编写代码。
Python 3 是未来，你不会后悔从最新版本的<a href="/learning-programming.html">编程语言</a>开始。</p>
<p>关于完全使用 Python 3 的建议的一个警告。如果您对使用<a href="/configuration-management.html">配置管理工具</a>的 DevOps 类型工作感兴趣，
例如 <a href="http://www.fabfile.org/">Fabric</a> 或 <a href="/ansible.html">Ansible</a>，
那么你可能不得不同时使用 Python 2 和 3，因为这些库的部分落后于完整的Python 3支持。</p>
<h2>可视化和项目</h2>
<p>由于从 Python 2 升级到3在社区内是如此巨大的事业，许多项目如雨后春笋般涌现，使转换更加容易。</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pythonhosted.org/six/">six</a> 是一个2/3兼容性库，它是许多流行的 Python 项目
  的依赖项，可以更容易同时支持 Python 2 和 3。</p>
</li>

   <h1>企业 Python</h1>
<p>关于 Python 等动态类型语言的一个错误观念认为它们用于构建企业级应用还不太可靠。然而，几乎所有的商业和政府机构都已经或多或少使用 Python 了，无论是作为不同的应用程序之间的粘合代码还是构建应用程序本身。</p>
<h2>什么是企业软件？</h2>
<p>企业软件是为机构的需求而非个人的需要创建的。为企业编写的软件通常需要与历史遗留系统，
例如现有的数据库和单机应用程序进行整合。通常也需与<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol">轻量级目录访问协议 (LDAP)</a> 和<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa746492%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">活动目录 (AD)</a>这样的认证系统整合。</p>
<p>机构开发企业软件，包含大量的定制需求以适应其运营模式的具体需要。 因此，由于组织内部不同派系之间
为争取软件能优先解决其各自的需求而罔顾他人的斗争，往往会导致软件开发过程变得异常复杂。</p>
<p>因企业软件建设过程涉及到许多利益相关者而产生的复杂局面，导致了大量的预算以及由机构中非技术人员
执行的过度审查。而这些非技术人员通常在编程语言和框架的选择上妄加评断--而他们是不应该做出技术设计决策的。</p>
<h2>为什么企业环境中存在对 Python 的误解？</h2>
<p>传统大型机构使用静态类型语言如 C++、 .NET 和 Java 构建企业软件。上世纪80年代和90年代的大公司，
如微软、Sun 和 甲骨文将这些语言标榜为”企业级“语言进行市场销售。其直接后果是，其它语言受到了冷落，
并被看作不适应 CIO 的艰难技术环境。除了 Java、C++ 和 .NET，其它语言都被认为是有风险的，
因而不值得投资使用。</p>
<p>此外，在 20 世纪 90 年代，”脚本语言“如 Python、Perl 和 Ruby 都还不够强大，
因为他们的核心标准库都仍处在开发阶段。像 <a href="/django.html">Django</a>、<a href="/flask.html">Flask</a> 
以及 Rails (Ruby 语言) 这样的框架还没有产生。 那时的网络还刚刚开始，
大多数企业应用还只是 Windows 系统上的桌面应用程序。 而 Python 根本不适合用于那样的环境。</p>
<h2>为什么说 Python 现在适合于构建企业级软件？</h2>
<p>从本世纪初到现在，许多动态类型语言及其生态系统有了很大的发展，而且在某些方面往往超越了其它生态系统。
Python、 Ruby 以及其它之前被冷落的语言现在有了更广阔并且维护良好的开源生态系统，
它们受到独立开发者和大公司的支持，包括微软、IBM、谷歌、Facebook、Dropbox、Twilio等等。</p>
<p>Python的开源库，特别是针对<a href="/web-frameworks.html">Web开发</a>和数据分析的那些代码，
对于任何语言来说，都是维护良好功能完备的典范。</p>
<p>同时，一些传统的企业软件开发语言如 Java 因受主要企业支持者投资不足影响，已经衰落了。
当 <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/018363">Oracle 于2009 年收购 Sun</a> 时，
在 Java 中增加新的语言特性以升级到 Java 7 的计划已被拖了很多一段时间。
Oracle 还<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/06/java-adware-mac/">在 Java 安装包中捆绑了不需要的广告软件</a>，
而 Python 社区绝不会容忍这种情况发生，因为这门语言是开源的，并不受某一公司控制。</p>
<p>其他的生态系统，如微软的 .NET 平台则发展的较好。微软在整个新世纪的早期阶段对 .NET 平台
进行了持继投资以促进及发展。</p>
<p>然而，微软的企业产品，它们的应用程序服务器和相关软件往往有昂贵的许可费用。此外，
微软也是开源运动的主要支持者，<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OneOfMicrosoftsBestKeptSecretsPythonToolsForVisualStudioPTVS.aspx">尤其对于 Python 来说</a>，
他们的 <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/features/python/">Visual Studio Python 工具集</a> 
提供了一流的<a href="/development-environments.html">开发环境</a>。</p>
<p>最终的结果是企业软件开发在过去的几十年中发生了翻天覆地的变化。CIO和技术管理人员，
如果想继续为他们的业务侧客户提供商业价值的话，
不再能忽视 Python 及伟大的开源社区在企业软件开发领域所取得的进展了。</p>
<h3>开源企业 Python 项目</h3>

   <h1>Python Community</h1>
<p>The Python programming language has a global community with millions of 
software developers who interact online and offline in thousands of virtual 
and physical locations.</p>
<p><img src="/img/logos/py.png" width="100%" alt="Python logo."></p>
<h2>Who drives the Python community?</h2>
<p>There are tens of thousands of Python developers who help steer the
community with local, regional and global events. Most, if not all of them, 
are members of the 
<a href="https://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation (PSF)</a>. The PSF
is a 501(c)(3) non-profit with the mission to "promote, protect, and advance 
the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the 
growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers."
Anyone that uses Python and has an active interest in the Python community 
can join the PSF as a <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/membership/">member</a>.
There are five classes of PSF members:</p>
<ol>
<li>Basic Members</li>
<li>Supporting Members</li>
<li>Sponsor Members</li>
<li>Managing Members</li>
<li>Contributing Members and Fellows</li>
</ol>
<p>Starting out by joining as a basic PSF member is a great way to show your
support and begin your own journey in working with the larger open source
ecosystem.</p>
<h2>What is a PEP and why do they matter?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/">Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs)</a> are
design documents that serve to drive Python's continued evolution. There
are <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/#pep-types">three kinds of PEPs</a> 
that serve disinct purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Standards track</em>: enhances the Python language with new features</li>
<li><em>Informational</em>: provides information to the Python community</li>
<li><em>Process</em>: modifies or makes improvements on topics relevant to
   the community but outside the Python language itself</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/">PEP 1</a> defines what a PEP is
and its purpose. In true computer science fashion, 
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/">PEP 0</a> also exists and it is an index
of all the PEPs that have been created.</p>
<p>The PEPs are important because they drive a transparent process to evolve
the language and broader ecosystems. Some other programming communities are
opaquely pushed by a single person or small cliques who refuse to 
understand outside perspectives. The insular nature of some groups typically
causes decline over time as the original community members move on to new
projects and no new members take their place.</p>
<h2>Conferences and events</h2>
<p>The Python online community has fantastic resources for learning but talking
to your fellow developers in-person at conferences, meetups and hackathons
is a crucial way to discover new tools and coding approaches. The following
resources provide perspective on offline events like 
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/">PyCon US</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://treyhunner.com/2018/04/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-first-pycon/">How to have a great first PyCon</a>
  gives a slew of advice on how to get the most out of your busy,
  and often overwhelming, PyCon experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clinton Dreisbach wrote two fantastic retrospectives for 
  <a href="http://www.dreisbach.us/blog/pycon-2015/">PyCon US 2015</a> (his first PyCon)
  and 
  <a href="http://www.dreisbach.us/blog/pycon-2016/">PyCon US 2016</a>. There are
  many other retrospectives for other 
  <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=261930">community-led conferences such as EuroPython</a>.
  These summaries can be a great way to get a slice of the experience
  before purchasing a ticket and booking a trip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One reason among many that Python conferences are spectacular experiences
  is the transparency about the how and why decisions are made for 
  event attendees. For example, PyCon is 
  <a href="https://pycon.blogspot.ca/2018/04/how-why-cities-and-dates-are-selected.html">transparent about the locations it selects for the conference</a>
  as well as why the community has a long-standing tradition of having
  <a href="http://jessenoller.com/blog/2011/05/25/pycon-everybody-pays">speakers pay their own way</a>
  just as any conference attendee would. From the outside it may appear
  these decisions are minor but they instill confidence in the stewardship
  of the Python ecosystem by current community leadership.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.jesshamrick.com/2014/04/18/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-pycon/">How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love PyCon</a>
  goes over one first-time PyCon attendee's nervousness about attending
  the conference and how she got over it while having a great time in
  the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://emptysqua.re/blog/seven-tips-for-pycon/">Don't Submit A Talk About Your Great Hack: Jesse's Seven Tips To Get Into PyCon</a>
  provides wonderful advice on how to approach the Call for Proposals (CFP)
  when you want to speak at a Python conference. The notes on how to balance
  specifics with vagarity in your title is particularly useful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Python community resources</h3>
<p>The Python community exists both online and offline. The following resources
will help you get connected with other Python developers in both forms. They
also provide context on how some of the major decisions are made within
the community.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.python.org/community/">community page on Python.org</a>
  provides a starter page with links to community-run newsletters, resources
  and conferences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many large active online communities on 
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/python">Reddit</a>, 
  <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/103393744324769547228">Google Plus</a>
  <a href="https://freenode.net/">IRC channels</a> such as #python, #python-dev
  and #distutils.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Python community has a concept known as "Benevolent Dictator For Life" 
  that may appear odd to newcomers. Essentially, Guido Van Rossum created
  the language and still has the ability to decide community arguments one
  way or the other. This post on the 
  <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=235725">origin of BDFL</a>
  has more context about Guido's role.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/30/python-community-and-python-at-dropbox">Python Community and Python at Dropbox</a>
  is an interview with <a href="https://github.com/jesstess">Jessica McKellar</a>,
  one of the most visible Python core committers and organizers for
  her fantastic coding and community work. She explains what it
  means to be a member and leader in the larger Python community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://snarky.ca/the-history-behind-the-decision-to-move-python-to-github/">The history behind the decision to move Python to GitHub</a>
  is a transparent and personal story by one of the Python Core Team
  members, <a href="https://github.com/brettcannon">Brett Cannon</a>, on why the
  main Python projects including the language itself are now 
  <a href="https://github.com/python/">hosted for development</a>
  on <a href="/github.html">GitHub</a>. The post is a wonderful read about the history
  of where Python development was centralized and how it moved from 
  SourceForge to svg.python.org and then over to GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/5/numbers-python-community-trends">Python community trends in 2017/2018</a>
  by <a href="https://github.com/ejodlowska">Ewa Jodlowska</a>, who is heavily involved 
  in PyCon and the overall Python ecosystem, provides a ton of data and 
  metrics on areas of community interest such as Python developers' 
  locations, <a href="/python-2-or-3.html">Python 3 adoption</a> and years of 
  experience as professional developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are some amazing communities within the overall Python ecosystem,
  such as <a href="http://www.pyladies.com/">PyLadies</a>, which encourages women
  to be strong, proactive community members.</p>
</li>
</ul>
   <h1>Companies Using Python</h1>
<p>The Python programming language is widely used by companies around the world 
to <a href="/web-development.html">build web apps</a>, <a href="/data.html">analyze data</a>,
<a href="/devops.html">automate operations via DevOps</a> and 
<a href="/enterprise-python.html">create reliable, scalable enterprise applications</a>.</p>
<p>There is also a fantastic list of 
<a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/OrganizationsUsingPython#Games">organizations using Python on the Python.org wiki</a>
as well as a detailed write-up of 
<a href="https://realpython.com/world-class-companies-using-python/">several top Python-powered companies on Real Python's blog</a>.</p>
<p>Many companies do not even realize they are using Python across their
organizations. For example, if a company is a "Java-only shop" but they
use IBM WebSphere as a web application server then they have to use
Python to script the server's configuration! Python has a habit of getting
in everywhere regardless of whether the usage is intentional.</p>
<h2>Financial institutions</h2>
<p>Python is widely-used across financial institutions, whether they are
hedge funds, large banks or regulators (see "Government Agencies" section
below).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Goldman-Sachs-ask-for-Python-language-as-a-skill-during-the-interview-for-an-analyst-role">Goldman Sachs uses Python</a>
  and often asks candidates about their experience with the language
  during the interview process. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can see publicly what companies are using internally by looking
  at job descriptions on sites like 
  <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Jobs/Goldman-Sachs-python-Jobs-EI_IE2800.0,13_KO14,20.htm">Glassdoor with "Python Goldman Sachs" keywords</a>
  and
  <a href="https://www.indeed.com/salaries/Python-Developer-Salaries-at-JPMorgan-Chase">Indeed for JP Morgan Chase</a>.
  Salaries and responsibilities vary widely based on the role and whether
  Python is used for data analysis, 
  <a href="/web-development.html">web application development</a> or DevOps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2016/09/07/python-packaging-at-paypal/">PayPal</a>
  uses Python across their entire infrastructure and often writes great
  technical blog posts on packaging, 
  <a href="https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2016/09/22/python-by-the-c-side/">optimization using C</a> 
  and <a href="https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2015/12/16/enterprise-overhaul-resolving-dns/">configuring DNS</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Large tech companies</h2>
<p>Large technology companies tend to be polyglot (use many programming 
languages rather than standardizing on one), with Python either as a
primary language or the "glue" that helps all the other languages fit
together. The following articles explain how these leading large companies 
like Uber, Twilio, Netflix and Facebook uses Python in their development 
stacks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://eng.uber.com/tech-stack-part-one/">Uber's tech stack</a> contains
  a significant amount of Python, which they documented in a series of 
  engineering posts. Part one describes the lower backend levels, which are 
  written in Python, with Node.js, Go and Java mixed in. 
  <a href="https://eng.uber.com/tech-stack-part-two/">Part two</a> explains the higher
  levels of the marketplace and user interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> uses Python with <a href="/django.html">Django</a>
  and the <a href="https://wagtail.io/">Wagtail</a> content management system to power
  the amazing <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio documentation</a> as well as
  <a href="https://www.twilio.com/quest">TwilioQuest</a>. They wrote a post about
  <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/11/building-twilioquest-with-twilio-sync-django-and-vue-js.html">how TwilioQuest was built</a> 
  that goes into detail on the code including the usage of the front-end 
  Vue.js framework. Twilio also uses <a href="/flask.html">Flask</a> to run the 
  <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api">REST API endpoints</a> and open sourced
  the <a href="https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful">Flask-RESTful</a> 
  framework so other developers could cut down the boilerplate in their
  web APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/16/python-at-netflix">Netflix uses Python</a> 
  throughout their organization to run chaos engineering tests and generally
  glue together the code from their high-functioning polyglot teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2560310/heavy-usage-of-python-at-google">Google uses Python extensively</a>
  and officially supports it internally as one of their three core languages,
  the other two being Java and Golang. While Google likely has every 
  programming language running somewhere in their infrastructure, Python 
  receives priority support due to its core language status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/11/how-did-dropbox-scale-to-175m-users-a-former-engineer-details-the-early-days/">Dropbox is well-known for using Python</a>
  across their application development, infrastructure and operations. They
  also did a good job of cornering the market on hiring well-known Python 
  core contributors for a period of time, such as 
  <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2012/12/welcome-guido/">Guido van Rossum</a> 
  and 
  <a href="https://opensource.com/business/16/7/red-hat-women-open-source-award-winner-jessica-mckellar">Jessica McKellar</a> 
  (although Jessica is now at a new company that she co-founded). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://thenewstack.io/instagram-makes-smooth-move-python-3/">Facebook and Instagram use Python 3</a>
  at scale. They've been very vocal about successfully making the migration 
  from the <a href="/python-2-or-3.html">Python 2 world into Python 3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A significant portion of <a href="https://github.com/reddit?language=python">Reddit is built in Python</a>
  and it is one of the largest sites at scale to use the programming language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Increment</em> covers usage of Python (and other programming languages) at
  Lyft, Digital Ocean, Sauce Labs, Slack and Fastly 
  <a href="https://increment.com/development/what-its-like-to-be-a-developer-at/">in this awesome overview post titled "What its like to be a developer at..."</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Government agencies</h2>
<p>Python usage in government agencies is widespread despite the reputation of
agencies as stodgy late technology adopters. Organizations range from 
financial industry regulators like the SEC and CFPB, to intelligence agencies
like the CIA, FBI and NSA.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cfpb">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)</a> 
  not only uses Python for running most of their applications but also open 
  sources many of those Python projects for other agencies (or any 
  organization) to use. For example, <a href="https://github.com/cfpb/collab">collab</a>
  is a <a href="/django.html">Django</a> project that provides an 
  <a href="/enterprise-python.html">enterprise application</a> for storing and looking 
  up information on employees and contractors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/about/success/usa/">NASA uses Python extensively</a>
  and <a href="https://code.nasa.gov/">open sources much of their software</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The United States 
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/5y2boe/cia_uses_python_a_lot/">Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)</a>
  appears to be a huge fan of using Python in its state sponsored hacking 
  tools. They even published their own Python code conventions 
  documentation due to how many developers at the agency are using the
  language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 
  <a href="http://jsdelfino.blogspot.com/2010/05/security-exchange-commission-python.html">SEC uses Python and proposes organizations use Python to comply with regulations</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A quick search for government jobs that require or recommend Python 
  <a href="https://sec.usajobs.gov/Search/?k=python&amp;p=1">via USAJobs</a> 
  turns up numerous listings at organizations such as the Smithsonian
  Institution, Department of Education, Department of the Navy and 
  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Industry-specific Python guides</h2>
<p>Python is so widely used across various industries that developers have
written guides specific to their occupations for how to use Python. The
following resources are guides for using Python in astronomy, social
sciences and other fields rather than specific companies.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://pbpython.com/">Practical Business Python</a> covers business-related
  topics such as how to automate generating large Excel spreadsheets or 
  perform analysis when your data is locked in Microsoft Office files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://python4astronomers.github.io/">Practical Python for Astronomers</a>
  gives open source workshop materials to teach astronomy students how to
  use Python for <a href="/data-analysis.html">data analysis</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://fbkarsdorp.github.io/python-course/">Python for the Humanities</a> is a
  textbook on the basics of text processing in Python. The material ramps 
  up quickly after the first chapter so you will likely want to combine 
  this walkthrough with other 
  <a href="/best-python-resources.html">great Python learning resources</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~gawron/python_for_ss/">Python for Social Scientists</a>
  and 
  <a href="https://realpython.com/python-for-social-scientists/">Real Python's Python for Social Scientists</a>
  walkthroughs are specific to fields that work with a lot of 
  <a href="/data.html">data</a> gathered from studies such as psychology, sociology
  and economics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
   <h1>Best Python Resources</h1>
<p>The Python community is amazing at sharing detailed resources and helping
beginners learn to program with the language. There are so many resources
out there though that it can be difficult to know how to find them. </p>
<p>This page aggregates the best general Python resources with descriptions of
what they provide to readers.</p>
<div class="well see-also">If you prefer to learn by watching videos check out the <a href="/best-python-videos.html">best Python videos</a>. You may also be interested in reading about <a href="/development-environments.html">development environments</a> to use for coding.</div>

<h2>New to programming</h2>
<p>If you're learning your first programming language these books were written
with you in mind. Developers learning Python as a second or later language
should skip down to the next section for "experienced developers".</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</a>
  is an incredible book for both non-developers and professional developers
  alike. Each chapter walks through a situation that can be automated using
  Python such as manipulating images, organizing your files and 
  programmatically controlling your mouse and keyboard to handle any sort
  of tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/csforall/">CS for All</a> is an open book by professors
  at Harvey Mudd College which teaches the fundamentals of computer science
  using Python. It's an accessible read and perfect for programming beginners.</p>

<li>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvK0UzFNw1Q">short 5 minute video</a>
  explains why it's better to think of projects you'd like to build and
  problems you want to solve with programming. Start working on those projects
  and problems rather than jumping into a specific language that's recommended
  to you by a friend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.grahamwheeler.com/posts/python-crash-course.html">A Python Crash Course</a>
  gives an awesome overview of the history of Python, what drives the 
  programming community and dives into example code. You will likely need
  to read this in combination with other resources to really let the syntax
  sink in, but it's a great article to read several times over as you 
  continue to learn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/tag/python">Python projects tag</a> on the

<p>There's a Udacity course by one of the creators of Reddit that shows how to 
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/web-development--cs253">use Python to build a blog</a>.
  It's a great introduction to web development concepts through coding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wrote a quick blog post on
  <a href="http://www.mattmakai.com/learning-python-for-non-developers.html">learning Python</a>
  that non-technical folks trying to learn to program may find useful.</p>
</li>

<h2>Python for specific occupations</h2>
<p>Python is powerful for many professions. If you're seeking to use Python in a
specific field, one of these guides may be the most appropriate for you.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~gawron/python_for_ss/">Python for Social Scientists</a>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://fbkarsdorp.github.io/python-course/">Python for the Humanities</a> is a
  textbook and course on the basics of Python and text processing. Note if you've
  never worked with Python before the material ramps up quickly after the first
  chapter so you will likely want to combine it with some other introduction to
  Python resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://python4astronomers.github.io/">Practical Python for Astronomers</a>
  provides open source workshop materials for teaching students studying 
  astronomy to use Python for data analysis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Experienced developers new to Python</h2>
<p>If you can already program in another language, these resources are better for
getting up to speed because they are more concise when explaining introductory 
topics.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/">Learn Python in y minutes</a>
  provides a whirlwind tour of the Python language. The guide is especially
  useful if you're coming in with previous software development experience
  and want to quickly grasp how the language is structured.</p>

  and <a href="/microservices.html">microservices</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developers familiar with other languages often have difficulty adapting to
  accepted Python code style. Make sure to read the 
  <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a> code style guidelines
  as well as 
  <a href="https://github.com/amontalenti/elements-of-python-style">The Elements of Python Style</a>
  to know the Python community standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://notesbyanerd.com/2017/12/29/essential-reads-for-any-python-programmer/">Essential Reads for Any Python Programmer</a>
  is a great collection of advice for developers coming to Python from another
  programming language ecosystem such as Java.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/how-to-develop-quality-python-code">How to Develop Quality Python Code</a>
  is a good read to begin learning about development environments, 
  application dependencies and project structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://pymotw.com/2/contents.html">Python module of the week</a> 
  chapters are a good way to get up to speed with the standard library.
  Doug Hellmann is also now updating the list for changes brought about 
  from the upgrade to Python 3 from 2.x.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kenneth Reitz's 
  <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python</a>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://composingprograms.com/">Composing Programs</a> shows how to build 
  compilers with Python 3, which is a good undertaking if you're looking
  to learn both more about the Python language and how compiles work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev">free-for-dev</a> is not specific
  to Python but it's a fantastic list of free tier resources for experienced
  developers. The list is especially handy if you want to try building a
  Python project and need new third party services to kick around while
  experimenting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Videos, screencasts and presentations</h2>
<p>Videos from conferences and meetups along with screencasts are listed on
the <a href="/best-python-videos.html">best Python videos</a> page.</p>
<h2>Curated Python packages lists</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python">awesome-python</a> is an incredible
  list of Python frameworks, libraries and software. I wish I had this
  page when I was just getting started. </p>

section for a curated list of both Python-specific and general software
development podcasts.</p>
<h2>Newsletters</h2>
<p>Python's active community constantly publishes new tutorials and 
walkthroughs. It is easier to keep up if you follow along by subscribing
to several email newsletters that round up and curate the best new 
resources. I subscribe to all of the following newsletters and find that
each one has its own unique take on what resources are most important
to send out to the community.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.pythonweekly.com/">Python Weekly</a> is a free weekly roundup
  of the latest Python articles, videos, projects and upcoming events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/email.html">Full Stack Python monthly newsletter</a> 
  is a monthly newsletter that focuses on a single topic each month. For 
  example, one month will aggregate great Flask resources, while another 
  month will provide WSGI server configurations.</p>

  another solid selection of new and existing tutorials along with an extensive
  <a href="https://python.libhunt.com/newsletter/archive">issues archive</a> with previous 
  links to resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://importpython.com/newsletter/">Import Python</a> is a newer newsletter
  than Python Weekly and PyCoder's Weekly. So far I've found this newsletter
  often pulls from different sources than the other two. It's well worth 
  subscribing to all three so you don't miss anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://pycoders.com/">PyCoder's Weekly</a> is another great free weekly
  email newsletter similar to Python Weekly. The best resources are generally
  covered in both newsletters but they often cover different articles
  and projects from around the web.</p>
</li>
</ul>
   <h1>Best Python Videos</h1>
<p>If you prefer to learn Python programming by watching videos then this is the
resource for you. I've watched hundreds of live technical talks and combed
through videos to pick out the ones with great speakers who'll teach you the
most about the language and ecosystem. </p>
<p>This page links to the best free videos as well as other video lists so you 
can do your own searching through the huge backlog of conference and meetup 
talks from the past several years. </p>

  pieces fit together. 
  The <a href="http://www.mattmakai.com/presentations/2014-full-stack-python-berlin.html">talk slides</a> are also available. Even though the talk is from 2014, almost all
  of the general web development principles remain consistent in 2018.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/heddle317">Kate Heddleston</a> gave a talk at PyCon 2014 
  called 
  "<a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2591/so-you-want-to-be-a-full-stack-developer-how-to">Full-stack Python Web Applications</a>"
  with clear visuals for how numerous layers of the Python web

  who created South (now Django Migrations as part of the core framework)
  and <a href="https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Django Channels</a>. He
  discusses the synchronous blocking worker design of 
  <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI</a> and why it is incompatible with asynchronous
  protocols like <a href="/websockets.html">WebSockets</a>. A potential solution
  could be a new protocol like Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI),
  but how far would the integration into Django need to go and would it
  be worth the pain? Andrew does a great job of mixing the philosophical
  questions with technical implementation details throughout the talk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://academy.realm.io/posts/christopher-downer-design-101-for-developers/">Design 101 for Developers</a>
  covers a difficult topic for many analytic-minded developers to learn:
  design. The talk is not specific to <a href="/web-development.html">web development</a> 
  or <a href="/web-design.html">web design</a> but instead explains general design
  principles such as spacing, consistency and making interactions obvious
  for a user.</p>

<h2>Core Python language videos</h2>
<p>The core Python programming language has many new features now that almost
all <a href="/python-community.html">community</a> resources are working on 
<a href="/python-2-or-3.html">Python 3</a> instead of split across legacy 2.x branches.
The following videos cover topics within the core Python language primarily
relevant to Python 3 features although some can be used with Python 2 as 
well.</p>

  data structure appropriate to your application and how the list and 
  dictionary can be used in many situations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guido van Rossum's 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgtL4S7Hrwo">Python Language</a> keynote
  talk from PyCon 2016 reinforced that there would be no Python version 2.8
  and that development on backported security releases into the Python 2
  branch would end by January 1, 2020. Guido also covered many topics
  important to the Python language community like expanding the number and
  backgrounds of core committers.</p>
</li>
<li>

  language and shepherding it through almost thirty years of releases.
  Fun fact: the question about whether Python being open source contributed
  to its success was my question when the podcast host Michael Kennedy asked 
  me what topics they should talk about.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/26/deploying-python-web-applications-updated">Deploying Python Web Applications</a>.
  <em>Spoiler alert</em>: this is the episode I was on Talk Python to Me explaining
  how <a href="/deployment.html">Python web application deployments</a> work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python Bytes talked extensively about
  <a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">object-relational mappers (ORMs)</a>
  on 
  <a href="https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/39/the-new-pypi">episode #39</a> where
  a lot of the discussion was based on the 
  <a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">Full Stack Python ORMs</a> page.
  Thanks guys, it was great to hear the feedback about what worked and what
  didn't work for you about the explanations!</p>

  organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another great Talk Python to Me episode, 
  <a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/120/python-in-finance">Python in Finance</a>,
  explains how Python is used in the broad finance industry for stock trading,
  quantitative analysis and data analytics. Check this one out if you have

   <h1>Development Environments</h1>
<p>A development environment is a combination of a <a href="text-editors-ides">text editor</a> 
and a Python runtime environment. The text editor allows you to write the code. 
The runtime environment implementation such as 
<a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">CPython</a> or <a href="https://pypy.org/">PyPy</a> 
provides the method for executing your code.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/tmux-vim-editor.png" width="100%" alt="tmux plus Vim editor on a dark background." class="shot rnd outl"></p>
<p>A text editor can be as simple as Notepad on Windows or more complicated 
as a complete integrated development environment (IDE) such as 
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> which runs on any major 
operating system.</p>
<h2>Why is a development environment necessary?</h2>
<p>Python code needs to be written, executed and tested to build
applications. The text editor provides a way to write the code. The 
interpreter allows it to be executed. Testing to see if the code does what
you want can either be done manually or by unit and functional tests. </p>
<div class="well see-also">While you're learning about development environments be sure to check out information on <a href="/vim.html">Vim</a> and <a href="/emacs.html">Emacs</a>.</div>

<h2>An example development environment</h2>
<p>Here's what I (the author of Full Stack Python, 
<a href="/about-author.html">Matt Makai</a>) use to develop most of my Python 
applications. I have a Macbook Pro with Mac OS X as its base operating 
system. <a href="/operating-systems.html">Ubuntu 18.04 LTS</a> is virtualized on top 
with <a href="https://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a>. My code is written in 
<a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> and executed with the 
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/">Python 3.6</a> release
via the command line. I use <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtualenv</a> 
to create separate Python interpreters with their own isolated
<a href="/application-dependencies.html">application dependencies</a> and
<a href="http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">virtualenvwrapper</a>
to quickly switch between the interpreters created by virtualenv.</p>
<p>That's a common set up but you can certainly write great code with a much
less expensive set up or a cloud-based development environment.</p>
<h2>Other developers' environments</h2>
<p>Often the best way to figure out how to get comfortable in your own
development environment is to see examples of how other experienced 
developers have set up their configurations. The following posts contain
the tools, editors and workflows that developers have taken the time to 
publicly document.</p>
<ul>

  some solid advice in the post about not adulterating your global Python
  installation as well as how to split out many virtual environments for
  Python 2 &amp; 3.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cloud hosted dev environments</h2>
<p>Several cloud-based development environments have popped up over the past
several years. These hosted environments can work well when you are learning
or stuck on a machine with a web browser but otherwise no administrative 
privileges to install your own software. Most of these have free tiers for 
getting started and then require payment as you scale up your application.</p>

</ul>
<h3>General dev environment resources</h3>
<p>Development environments are unique to each programmer because Python is
used for many different purposes. The following guides range from 
<a href="/web-development.html">web development</a> to 
<a href="/devops.html">DevOps</a> and from 
<a href="/learning-programming.html">getting started</a> to <a href="/data.html">data science</a>.
Even though your environment requirements are unique, you should be able to 
find someone who has set up something similar to what you need. Use that
configuration as a starting point and customize it from there.</p>

   <h1>Text Editors and IDEs</h1>
<p>Text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) are applications
for <a href="/learning-programming.html">writing code</a>. These applications are the
primary user interface for developers to create their own programs.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/vim-dark-bg.jpg" width="100%" alt="Vim with basic configuration options on a dark background." class="shot outl rnd"></p>
<p><a href="/vim.html">Vim</a> is an example of a text editor implementation that can be 
expanded into a full Python IDE using configuration files and plugins.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Text editors and IDEs are a concept implemented by <a href="/vim.html">Vim</a>, <a href="/emacs.html">Emacs</a>, <a href="/sublime-text.html">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="/jupyter-notebook.html">Jupyter Notebook</a> and several other applications. Learn how the parts fit together in the <a href="/development-environments.html">development environments</a> chapter or view <a href="/table-of-contents.html">all topics</a>.</div>

<h2>Why is a text editor or IDE necessary?</h2>
<p>Where will you write your code if you do not have a text editor? Your
<a href="/development-environments.html">development environment</a> must include
a text editor so you can enter, edit and delete characters to create
Python applications.</p>
<p>Preferrably your editor will have a monospace font. It will also get out
of your way, so no "smart" correction or automatic letter capitalization.
The more comfortable you become in your editor of choice the faster you
can figure out how to implement that next feature in your application or
squash that pesky bug that you just found.</p>
<h2>What's the difference between editors and IDEs?</h2>
<p>IDEs contain text editors but many text editors, for example Notepad included
with Windows, do not include IDE features. Many text editors such as
Vim or Emacs have IDE features by default but then can be further customized
to add file trees, syntax highlighting, line numbers and syntax checking 
that is commonly found in full-featured IDEs.</p>
<h2>Open source text editors</h2>
<p>Open source provides an embarrassment of riches when its come to stable, 
extendable text editors. Some version of these editors, such as the original
vi version of Vim, have been used for over 40 years! You can't go wrong with
using one of the editors as your development environment foundation.</p>
<p>The following text editor implementations can be upgraded with
configurations and plugins to become full-fledged IDEs when a developer
wants that kind of functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/vim.html">Vim</a> is my editor of choice and installed by default
  on most *nix systems.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Python-specific IDEs</h2>
<p>Editors built from the foundation up are not necessarily better than 
general-purpose text editors and IDEs like <a href="/vim.html">Vim</a> and 
<a href="/emacs.html">Emacs</a> but they are typically much easier to configure for

   <h1>Vim</h1>
<p>Vim, short for Vi IMproved, is a configurable text editor often used as
a Python development environment. Vim proponents commonly cite the numerous
plugins, Vimscript and logical command language as major Vim strengths.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vim.org/" style="border:none"><img src="/img/logos/vim-the-editor.jpg" width="100%" alt="Vim logo." class="shot rnd outl"></a></p>
<h2>Why is Vim a good Python development environment?</h2>
<p>Vim's philosophy is that developers are more productive when they avoid
taking their hands off the keyboard. Code should flow naturally from the
developer's thoughts through the keyboard and onto the screen. Using a mouse
or other peripheral is a detriment to the rate at which a developer's
thoughts become code.</p>
<p>Vim has a logical, structured command language. When a beginner is learning
the editor she may feel like it is impossible to understand all the key
commands. However, the commands stack together in a logical way so that over
time the editor becomes predictable.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Vim is an implementation of the <a href="/text-editors-ides.html">text editors and IDEs</a> concept. Learn how these parts fit together in the <a href="/development-environments.html">development environments</a> chapter or view <a href="/table-of-contents.html">all topics</a>.</div>

<h2>Configuring Vim with a Vimrc file</h2>
<p>The Vimrc file is used to configure the Vim editor. A Vimrc file can range
from nothing in it to very complicated with hundreds or thousands of lines
of configuration commands.</p>
<p>Here's a short, commented example .vimrc file I use for Python development
to get a feel for some of the configuration statements:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&quot; enable syntax highlighting
syntax enable

&quot; show line numbers
set number

&quot; set tabs to have 4 spaces
set ts=4

&quot; indent when moving to the next line while writing code
set autoindent

&quot; expand tabs into spaces
set expandtab

&quot; when using the &gt;&gt; or &lt;&lt; commands, shift lines by 4 spaces
set shiftwidth=4

&quot; show a visual line under the cursor&#39;s current line
set cursorline

&quot; show the matching part of the pair for [] {} and ()
set showmatch

&quot; enable all Python syntax highlighting features
let python_highlight_all = 1
</pre></div>


<p>Here is how these configuration options look with a dark background on
Mac OS X while editing the markdown for this webpage (how meta!).</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/vim-dark-bg.jpg" width="100%" alt="Vim with basic configuration options on a dark background." class="shot rnd outl"></p>
<p>Take a look at another example using these configuration options, this time
with a light background and editing Python code from my
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations">Choose Your Own Adventures Presentations</a>
project.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/vim-white-bg.png" width="100%" alt="Vim with basic configuration options on a white background." class="shot rnd outl"></p>
<p>The Vimrc file lives under the home directory of the user account running
Vim. For example, when my user account is 'matt', on Mac OS X my Vimrc
file is found at <code>/Users/matt/.vimrc</code>. On Ubuntu Linux my .vimrc file
can be found within the <code>/home/matt/</code> directory.</p>
<p>If a Vimrc file does not already exist, just create it within the user's
home directory and it will be picked up by Vim the next time you open the
editor.</p>
<h3>Vim tutorials</h3>
<p>Vim has a reputation for a difficult learning curve, but it's much easier
to get started with these tutorials.</p>

  discusses one of Vim's core principles: command composability. Vim has 
  a language where simple commands are combined to execute more advanced 
  operations. For example, in command mode,<code>$</code> moves to the end of a line.
  When <code>$</code> is preceded by <code>d</code> then everything to the end of the line is
  deleted. Over time the simple commands become intuitive and the 
  combinations become more powerful than having distinct commands such as
  a drop-down menu with a specific option to delete all text until the end
  of the line.</p>

  <code>sudo apt-get install vim</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're using PyCharm as your IDE you won't need to install Vim as a
  separate text editor - instead use the
  <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164">IdeaVim</a> PyCharm plugin to get
  Vim keybindings, visual/insert mode, configuration with ~/.ideavimrc and
  other Vim emulation features.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using Vim as a Python IDE</h3>

<h3>Vim Plugin Managers</h3>
<p>If you use many Vim plugins together it is really handy to have a plugin
managers to sort out all of the dependencies. The following plugin managers
are the most commonly-used ones in the Vim ecosystem.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim">Vundle</a> comes highly recommended
  as a plugin manager for Vim.</p>

  minimalistic Vim plugin manager.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Niche tutorials</h3>
<p>After you have been using Vim for awhile there will be features you bump
into without realizing they were ever there. The following tutorials show
how to use some specific niche features. You may already know about these
if you have been using Vim for awhile but everyone's learning path is 
different so it's useful to do a quick scan to make sure you are not missing
anything.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/vim-number/">Vim’s absolute, relative and hybrid line numbers</a>
  shows how to change the line numbering scheme. There was a period of 
  time I used relative line numbers although I eventually switched back
  to absolute numbers. The usefulness of these schemes is often dependent
  on what language you are working in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.blaenkdenum.com/posts/a-simpler-vim-statusline/">A simpler Vim statusline</a>
  explains how to customize your bottom screen statusline <em>without</em> using
  plugins such as <a href="https://github.com/powerline/powerline">vim-powerline</a> 
  or <a href="https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline">vim-airline</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/alevchuk/vim-clutch">vim-clutch</a> is a really cool
  project and walkthrough that shows how you can create a foot pedal to
  switch between Normal and Insert modes instead of using the typical ESC
  key (or a remapped key).</p>
</li>
</ul>
   <h1>Emacs</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> is an extensible text editor 
that can be customized by writing Emacs Lisp (Elisp) code.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"><img src="/img/logos/emacs-wide.png" width="100%" alt="Emacs community logo." class="shot"></a></p>
<h3>Why is Emacs a good choice for Python coding?</h3>
<p>Emacs is designed to be customized via the built-in Lisp interpreter and
package manager. The package manager, named package.el, has menus for
handling installation. The largest Lisp Package Archive is 
<a href="http://melpa.org">Melpa</a>, which provides automatic updates from upstream
sources.</p>
<p>Macros are useful for performing repetitive actions in Emacs. A macro
is just a recording of a previous set of keystrokes that can be replayed
to perform future actions.</p>
<p>Hooks, which are Lisp variables that hold lists of functions to call,
provide an extension mechanism for Emacs. For example,
<code>kill-emacs-hook</code> runs before exiting Emacs so functions can be loaded
into that hook to perform necessary actions before the exiting completes.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Emacs is an implementation of the <a href="/text-editors-ides.html">text editors and IDEs</a> concept. Learn how these parts fit together in the <a href="/development-environments.html">development environments</a> chapter or view <a href="/table-of-contents.html">all topics</a>.</div>

<h3>Python plus Emacs resources</h3>
<p>Emacs is programming language agnostic by design so it takes some effort
to customize the editor as a Python-specific 
<a href="/development-environments.html">development environment</a>. The following
resources will walk you through the setups that other developers have 
created for working with Python.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://realpython.com/blog/python/emacs-the-best-python-editor/">Emacs - the Best Python Editor?</a>
  continues the excellent Real Python series showing how to get started

</li>
</ul>
<h3>General Emacs resources</h3>
<p>Emacs, like any powerful tool, takes significant intentional practice to
use properly. These resources provide instructions for becoming comfortable
with the editor itself rather than specific Python environment configuration
advice.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html">GNU Emacs Manual</a>

  <a href="https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs">Git repository of the configuration</a>
  for using and gaining experience with Emacs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Programming Emacs with Elisp</h3>
<p>Emacs can be completely customized and rewritten by using the Emacs-specific
Lisp programming language named Emacs Lisp (Elisp). The ability to completely
modify the editor is part of what led to the old joke "a great operating 
system, lacking only a decent editor". Nevertheless, Elisp is what gives 
Emacs its text editing power despite the perception that the editor is 
overkill for working with text.</p>
<p>These tutorials will help you learn the Elisp language and use it to modify
Emacs for your own purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/eintr/index.html">An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp</a>
  is the "official" introduction intended for a beginner programming
  audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/chrisdone/elisp-guide">Emacs Lisp Guide</a> is for 
  developers that have been using Emacs for a while and want to start
  making extensions to get more out of the editor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LearnEmacsLisp">Emacs Wiki</a> contains
  advice and resources for getting oriented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp.html">Practical Emacs Lisp</a> contains
  a bunch of useful code and focuses on examples throughout the tutorial.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notable Elisp Packages</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html">Elisp</a> is the 
<a href="https://common-lisp.net/">LISP</a> programming language dialect that Emacs
using for adding and customizing functionality in the editor. The following
Elisp packages are existing Elisp libraries that many developers using Emacs 
incorporate into their environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a> allows the user to inspect and modify
  Git repositories from within Emacs.</p>
</li>

  JavaScript. It can be integrated within a Django project
  via the <a href="https://github.com/proofit404/tern-django">tern-django</a> package.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Popular user configurations</h3>
<p>Numerous custom Emacs user configurations exist that bundle together custom
Elisp packages and libraries to handle creating a powerful integrated 
development environment. I recommend trying to configure Emacs yourself 
before you dive into any of these configurations so it is easier to
learn base Emacs rather than get distracted by the customizations.</p>

</ul>
   <h1>Sublime Text</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> is a commonly-used text editor 
used to write Python code. Sublime Text's slick user interface along with its 
numerous extensions for syntax highlighting, source file finding and analyzing 
<a href="/code-metrics.html">code metrics</a> make the editor more accessible to new
programmers than some other applications like <a href="/vim.html">Vim</a> and 
<a href="/emacs.html">Emacs</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" style="border:none"><img src="/img/logos/sublime-text.jpg" width="100%" alt="Sublime Text logo." class="shot outl rnd"></a></p>
<div class="well see-also">Sublime Text is an implementation of the <a href="/text-editors-ides.html">text editors and IDEs</a> concept. Learn how these parts fit together in the <a href="/development-environments.html">development environments</a> chapter or view <a href="/table-of-contents.html">all topics</a>.</div>

<h2>What makes Sublime Text awesome?</h2>
<p>Sublime Text is often the first editor that newer programmers pick up because
it works on all operating systems and it is far more approachable than 
<a href="/emacs.html">Emacs</a>, <a href="/vim.html">Vim</a> or even <a href="/pycharm.html">PyCharm</a>.</p>
<p>It is easy to get started in Sublime because the menus and options are 
accessible by using a mouse. There are no different modes to learn like 
Vim's normal and insert modes. The keyboard shortcuts can be learned over
time rather than all at once in the case of Vim or Emacs. </p>
<p>Sublime Text works well for beginners as soon as they install it and then
can be extended with many of the features provided by an IDE like 
<a href="/pycharm.html">PyCharm</a> as a developer's skill level ramps up.</p>
<p>An additional bonus of using Sublime Text as a Python developer is that
<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/plugin-basics">plugins are written in Python</a>.
Python developers can extend Sublime Text with their own programming language
rather than learn a new language like Emacs' Elisp or Vim's Vimscript.</p>
<h2>Why use any other editor if Sublime is so great?</h2>
<p>Picking a <a href="/text-editors-ides.html">text editor or IDE</a> to use tends to 
be a weirdly personal decision for each developer. Yet it makes sense when
you realize that you are going to spend hours upon hours every day in your
chosen environment so why not make sure it is one that is enjoyable and
highly productive? </p>
<p>For some folks they prefer <a href="/vim.html">Vim</a>'s keyboard-driven style, 
<a href="/pycharm.html">PyCharm</a>'s Swiss Army Knife set of Python tools or one of 
the many other editors with its own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>The only "best" editor choice is to pick one that works really well for you
and stick to it. Master your tool so it gets out of your way and enables
as much time in 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">programming flow</a> as 
possible.</p>
<h3>Python-specific Sublime Text resources</h3>
<p>There are many Python-specific Sublime Text tutorials and resources because
the editor is so frequently used to create Python applications. The following
links should get your editor customized with linters,

   <h1>Jupyter Notebook</h1>
<p><a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a> 
(<a href="https://github.com/jupyter/notebook">open source code</a>), which began 
as the iPython Notebook project, is a 
<a href="/development-environments.html">development environment</a> for writing
and executing Python code. Jupyter Notebook is often used for exploratory 
<a href="/data-analysis.html">data analysis</a> and visualization. </p>
<p><a href="http://jupyter.org/" style="border:none"><img src="/img/logos/jupyter.png" width="100%" alt="Jupyter Notebook project logo." class="shot"></a></p>
<p>Project Jupyter is the top-level project name for all of the subprojects under 
development, which includes Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebooks can also run 
code for other programming languages such as <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> and 
<a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>.</p>
<h3>How does Jupyter Notebook work?</h3>
<p>The key piece of Jupyter Notebook infrastructure is a web application that
runs locally for creating and sharing documents that contain embedded code and 
execution results.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/jupyter-screenshot.jpg" width="100%" alt="Screenshot of Jupyter Notebook running in the browser and server in terminal." class="shot"></p>

<h3>How are IPython Notebook and Jupyter Notebook related?</h3>
<p>IPython Notebook was the original project that proved that there was great
demand among data scientists and programmers for an interactive, repeatable
development environment. Jupyter Notebook became the new official name for the
overall project during 
<a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/the-big-split-9d7b88a031a7">The Big Split</a>
after the IPython Notebook project matured into distinct submodules such as the 
interactive shell, notebook document format and user interface widgets tools.
However, the IPython Notebook name sticks around as the Python backend for
Jupyter Notebook which is seriously confusing if you are searching the internet
and come across both current and old articles that use all of these names
interchangeably.</p>
<h3>Jupyter Notebook beginner tutorials</h3>
<p>Jupyter Notebook's powerful analysis and visualization environment can be 
intimidating even for experienced developers that are new to the tool. The
following tutorials will explain the basics so you can quickly figure out
your own productive workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/">Jupyter Notebook for Beginners: A Tutorial</a>
  is a great place to start if you have never before used the tool.

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/ipython-jupyter">IPython Or Jupyter?</a>
  covers the evolution of the Notebook concept from its origins in the IPython
  Notebook implementation through the 
  <a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/the-big-split-9d7b88a031a7">IPython and Jupyter split</a>
  that happened in 2015 that separated IPython Notebook into logical subprojects.
  The post kicks off with some fun lesser-known historical context on other
  data science notebook projects such as MATLAB and Mathematica to set the stage 
  for IPython and Jupyter's creation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

   <h1>Terminal Multiplexers</h1>
<p>A terminal multiplexer provides separation between where a <a href="/shells.html">shell</a>
is running and where the shell is accessed. Each shell can be running on a 
different computer, but to the developer it does not matter where each 
shell is being executed.</p>
<p>For example, a developer could have many shells running within a 
terminal, like the following screenshot. </p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/terminal-multiplexer-tmux.jpg" width="100%" alt="tmux terminal multiplexer with many panes." class="shot"></a></p>
<p>The above terminal window is using the tmux terminal multiplexer implementation
with two windows and three panes. </p>
<h2>Why are terminal multiplexers awesome?</h2>
<p>Developers gain greater control over the usage of their shells by working
with a terminal multiplexer.</p>
<p>Shells are typically executed locally on a computer but terminal multiplexers 
allow one or more virtual shells to be run within a single terminal. Shells 
can also be left running within the multiplexer and attached to again from a 
different machine.</p>
<p>Terminal multiplexers are used by developers to run many virtual shells 
within a single terminal. These shells can be run via a mix of local, 
remote, containerized and virtualized resources. The shells can also
be persisted and moved while running from one computer to another.</p>
<h3>Terminal multiplexer implementations</h3>
<p>Many terminal multiplexer implementations exist, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/tmux.html">tmux</a></p>

   <h1>Environment configuration</h1>
<p>Properly configuring a development, test or production environment is 
important for the successful execution of your Python application.</p>
<p>There are many de facto names for environments:</p>
<ol>
<li>Local development</li>
<li>Development / integration</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Staging</li>
<li>Production</li>
</ol>
<p>The above list provides the common environment names but there
can be a limitless number and each organization has their own 
configuration.</p>
<h2>Environment variables</h2>
<p>Environment variables are modifiable system values that can be read 
by Python applications to affect a program's execution.</p>
<p>One answer I found very useful when learning about getting environment
variables in Python code is 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16924471/difference-between-os-getenv-and-os-environ-get">knowing the difference between os.getenv and os.environ.get</a>.
Either one can be used in your applications but there are slight differences 
that can make one better than the other in various situations.</p>
<p>Other useful environment variables resources:
* <a href="https://12factor.net/">The Twelve-Factor App</a> describes a method for
  securing environment data for your applications. The twelve factors are
  commonly referenced across many programming ecosystems, not just Python,
  so it's worthwhile to familiarize yourself with how to use this method

   <h1>Application Dependencies</h1>
<p>Application dependencies are the libraries other than your project code
that are required to create and run your application. </p>
<h2>Why are application dependencies important?</h2>
<p>Python web applications are built upon the work done by thousands of open
source programmers. Application dependencies include not only web frameworks but
also libraries for scraping, parsing, processing, analyzing, visualizing, 
and many other tasks. Python's ecosystem facilitates discovery, retrieval and 
installation so applications are easier for developers to create.</p>
<h2>Finding libraries</h2>
<p>Python libraries are stored in a central location known as the 
<a href="https://pypi.org/">Python Package Index</a>. PyPi contains
search functionality with results weighted by usage and relevance based on
keyword terms.</p>
<p>Besides PyPi there are numerous resources that list common or "must-have" 
libraries. Ultimately the decision for which application dependencies are
necessary for your project is up to you and the functionality you're looking
to build. However, it's useful to browse through these lists in case you come 
across a library to solve a problem by reusing the code instead of writing it
all yourself. A few of the best collections of Python libraries are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsefulModules">Python.org's useful modules</a>
  which groups modules into categories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/trending?l=python">GitHub Explore Trending repositories</a>
  shows the open source Python projects trending today, this week, and this 
  month.</p>

<p>This list of <a href="http://freepythontips.wordpress.com/2013/07/30/20-python-libraries-you-cant-live-without/">20 Python libraries you can’t live without</a>
  is a wide-ranging collection from data analysis to testing tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wikipedia actually has an extensive 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Python_software">page dedicated to Python libraries</a> 
  grouped by categories.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Isolating dependencies</h2>
<p>Dependencies are installed separately from system-level packages to prevent 
library version conflicts. The most common isolation method is 
<a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>. Each virtualenv is its
own copy of the Python interpreter and dependencies in the site-packages
directory. To use a virtualenv it must first be created with the virtualenv
command and then activated.</p>
<p>The virtualenv stores dependencies in an isolated environment. The web 
application then relies only on that virtualenv instance which has a separate
copy of the Python interpreter and site-packages directory. A high level of
how a server configured with virtualenv can look is shown in the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/server-setup.png" alt="How the virtualenv separates dependencies on the server." width="100%" class="shot" /></p>
<h2>Installing Python dependencies</h2>
<p>The recommended way to install Python library dependencies is with the 
<a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/">pip</a> command when a virtualenv
is activated.</p>
<p>Pip and virtualenv work together and have complementary responsibilities.
Pip downloads and installs application dependencies from the central
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPi</a> repository. </p>
<h2>requirements.txt</h2>
<p>The pip convention for specifying application dependencies is with a 
<code>requirements.txt</code> file. When you build a Python web application you 
should include <code>requirements.txt</code> in the base directory of your project.</p>
<p>Python projects' dependencies for a web application should be specified 
with pegged dependencies like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>django==1.11.0
bpython==0.12
django-braces==0.2.1
django-model-utils==1.1.0
logutils==0.3.3
South==0.7.6
requests==1.2.0
stripe==1.9.1
dj-database-url==0.2.1
django-oauth2-provider==0.2.4
djangorestframework==2.3.1
</pre></div>


<p>Pegged dependencies with precise version numbers or Git tags are important 
because otherwise the latest version of a dependency will be used. While
it may sound good to stay up to date, there's no telling if your application
actually works with the latest versions of all dependencies. Developers should 
deliberately upgrade and test to make sure there were no backwards-incompatible
modifications in newer dependency library versions.</p>
<h2>setup.py</h2>
<p>There is another type of dependency specification for Python libraries
known as 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1471994/what-is-setup-py">setup.py</a>.
Setup.py is a standard for distributing and installing Python libraries.
If you're building a Python library, such as 
<a href="http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/underwear">underwear</a> you must include setup.py
so a dependency manager can correctly install both the library as well as
additional dependencies for the library. There's still quite a bit of 
confusion in the Python community over the difference between 
requirements.txt and setup.py, so read this 
<a href="https://caremad.io/2013/07/setup-vs-requirement/">well written post</a> for
further clarification.</p>

Python 3's standard library as of version 3.3. However, there are numerous
other open source libraries that can be helpful when managing application
dependencies in your projects, as listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv">Autoenv</a> is a tool for activating
  environment variables stored in a <code>.env</code> file in your projects' home
  directories. Environment variables aren't managed by virtualenv and although
  virtualenvwrapper has some hooks for handling them, it's often easiest to
  use a shell script or <code>.env</code> file to set them in a development environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Pipenv</a> is a newer Python 
  packaging and dependency management library that has seen some adoption
  in place of the standard <code>pip</code> library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs">Pipreqs</a> searches through a project for
  dependencies based on imports. It then generates a <code>requirements.txt</code> file
  based on the libraries necessary to run those dependencies. Note though that
  while this could come in handy with a legacy project, the version numbers
  for those libraries will not be generated with the output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bartTC/pip-check">pip-check</a> presents a nicely-formatted
  list of all your installed dependencies and the status of whether or not
  updates are available for each of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/prakashdanish/pip-name">pip-name</a> is a straightforward
  library that looks up package names on PyPI and tells you whether or not
  the library name is already taken.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Application dependencies learning checklist</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ensure the libraries your web application depends on are all captured in 
   a <code>requirement.txt</code> file with pegged versions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An easy way to capture currently installed dependencies is with the 
   <code>pip freeze</code> command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a fresh virtualenv and install the dependencies from your 
   <code>requirements.txt</code> file by using the <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> 
   command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check that your application runs properly with the fresh virtualenv and 
   only the installed dependencies from the <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>Virtual environments (virtualenvs)</h1>
<p>Virtual environments, implemented by the library virtualenv and venv 
(added to Python standard library in Python 3.3 via 
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0405/">PEP 405</a>), separate project
dependencies, such as the <a href="/django.html">Django</a> library code, 
from your code projects. For example, if you have three projects,
one that uses Django 1.7, another that uses Django 2.0 and another project
that does not use Django at all, you will have three virtualenvs that
each contain those dependencies separated from each other.</p>
<h2>How do virtualenvs work?</h2>
<p>Virtualenv provides dependency isolation for Python projects. A
virtualenv creates a separate copy of the Python installation that is
clean of existing code libraries and provides a directory for new
<a href="/application-dependencies.html">application dependencies</a> on a 
per-project basis. A programmer can technically use a virtualenv for many 
projects at once but that is not consider to be a good practice.</p>

   <h1>Localhost tunnels</h1>
<p>A localhost tunnel establishes a connection between your local machine
and a remote connection. The connection is intended to proxy traffic 
from a publicly-addressable IP address and URL to your local machine.
Localhost tunnels are most useful for allowing a tester to connect 
to a server running on your local development system so they can try
out an in-development application you are building but have not yet
<a href="/deployment.html">deployed</a>.</p>
<h3>Localhost tunnel services</h3>
<p>There are numerous localhost tunnel services that have similar features.
The following services are listed in order from ones I have had the most 
experience with to the ones I have not used.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://ngrok.com/">ngrok</a> is the service I use most often. It is
  easy and worth the small fee to upgrade your account with a few
  extra features such as fixed, customizable subdomains.</p>

  that I have not used myself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
   <h1>Source control</h1>
<p>Source control, also known as <em>version control</em>, stores software code files
with a detailed history of every modification made to those files.</p>
<h2>Why is source control necessary?</h2>
<p>Version control systems allow developers to modify code without worrying 
about permanently screwing something up. Unwanted changes can be easily rolled
back to previous working versions of the code. </p>
<p>Source control also makes team software development easier. One developer 
can combine her code modifications with other developers' code through 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff</a> views that show line-by-line 
changes then merge the appropriate code into the main code branch.</p>
<p>Version control is a necessity on all software projects regardless of 
development time, codebase size or the programming language used. Every
project should immediately begin by using a version control system such
as Git or Mercurial.</p>
<h2>Monorepo vs Multirepo</h2>
<p>There is a spectrum of philosophies for how to store projects within
source code repositories. </p>
<p>On one extreme end of the spectrum, every line of code for every project 
within an organization is stored <strong>in a single repository</strong>. That approach 
is called <em>monorepo</em> and it is used by companies like Google. On the other 
end of the spectrum, there are potentially tens of thousands or more 
repositories that store parts of projects. That approach is known as
<em>multirepo</em> or <em>manyrepo</em>. </p>
<p>For example, in a <a href="/microservices.html">microservices</a> architecture, there
could be thousands of microservices and each one is stored within its own
repository. No one repository contains the code for the entire application
created by the interaction of the microservices.</p>
<p>There are many hybrid strategies for how to store source code that fall
between these opposite approaches. What to choose will depend on your
organization's needs, resources and culture.</p>
<h2>Source control during deployment</h2>
<p>Pulling code during a deployment is a potential way source control systems fit
into the deployment process. </p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/app-source-control.png" width="100%" class="shot" alt="App deployment uses a server to pull from the source control system."></p>
<p>Note that some developers recommend deployment pipelines package the source 
code to deploy it and never have a production environment touch a source 
control system directly. However, for small scale deployments it's often
easiest to pull from source code when you're getting started instead of 
figuring out how to wrap the Python code in a system installation package.</p>
<h2>Source control projects</h2>
<p>Numerous source control systems have been created over the past several
decades. In the past, proprietary source control software offered features
tailored to large development teams and specific project workflows. However,
open source systems are now used for version control on the largest and most
complicated software projects in existence. There's no reason why your project
should use anything other than an open source version control system in
today's Python development world. The two primary choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/git.html">Git</a> is a free and open source distributed version
  control system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/mercurial.html">Mercurial</a> is similar to Git, also a free
  and open source distributed version control system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/apache-subversion.html">Subversion</a> is a centralized system where
  developers must check files in and out of the hosted repository to minimize
  merge conflicts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hosted version control services</h2>
<p>Git and Mercurial can be downloaded and run on your own server. However,
it's easy and cheap to get started with a 
<a href="/hosted-source-control-services.html">hosted version control service</a>.
You can transition away from the service at a later time by moving your 
repositories if your needs change. A couple of recommended hosted version
control services are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> has both a self-hosted version of its
  open source software as well as their hosted version with 
  <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/">pricing</a> for businesses that need
  additional hosting support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> is a software-as-a-service platform that 
  provides a user interface, tools and backup for developers to use with their 
  <a href="/git.html">Git</a> repositories. Accounts are free for public open source 
  development and private Git repositories can also be hosted for 
  <a href="https://github.com/pricing">$7 per month</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> is 
  <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a>'s software-as-a-service tool that 
  with a user interface, comparison tools and backup for Git projects. There 
  are many features in BitBucket focused on making it easier for groups of 
  developers to work on projects together. BitBucket also has private 
  repositories for up to five users. Users pay for hosting private 
  repositories with more than five users.</p>

<h3>Monorepo vs multirepo resources</h3>
<p>Monorepo versus multirepo version control strategies are a weirdly 
contentious topic in software development, likely because once a policy
is set for an organization it is exceptionally difficult to change
your approach. The following resources give more insight into the debate
on how to structure your repositories.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://notes.burke.libbey.me/metarepo/">Monorepo, Manyrepo, Metarepo</a>

</ul>
<h3>Git distributed source control system</h3>
<p><a href="/git.html">Git</a> is the most widely-used source control system currently
in use. Its distributed design eliminates the need to check files in

</ul>
<h3>Source control learning checklist</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick a version control system. Git is recommended because on the web there
   are a significant number of tutorials to help both new and advanced users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn basic use cases for version control such as committing changes, 
   rolling back to earlier file versions and searching for when lines of code 
   were modified during development history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure your source code is backed up in a central repository. A central
   repository is critical not only if your local development version is 
   corrupted but also for the deployment process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate source control into your deployment process in three ways. First,
   pull the project source code from version control during deployments. 
   Second, kick off deployments when code is modified by using webhooks or 
   polling on the repository. Third, ensure you can roll back to a previous 
   version if a code deployment goes wrong.</p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>Git</h1>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a distributed open source 
<a href="/source-control.html">source control</a> (also referred to as "version 
control") system commonly used to track and manage file changes. Git is 
frequently used as the version control system for Python projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/logos/git.png" width="100%" alt="Official Git logo." class="technical-diagram"></a></p>
<div class="well see-also">Git is an implementation of the <a href="/source-control.html">source control</a> concept. Learn how these pieces fit together in the <a href="/development-environments.html">development environments</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>Why is Git widely-used by developers?</h2>
<p>Git is a <em>distributed</em> version control system (DVCS) compared to the 
centralized models previously provided by 
<a href="/apache-subversion.html">Subversion</a> and <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</a>.
Files would need to be "checked out" over the network by a single person at
a time while she was woring. The network transfer speed as well as the 
blocking check out model became a significant bottleneck, especially for 
large development teams. </p>
<p>Git clones a full repository and its entire history instead of just the 
current state of a file. Developers only require a network connection when
pulling updates and pushing changes to a backup repository. The commit log
and file histories are stored and transmitted far more efficiently than
prior version control systems to maximize the effectiveness of the 
distributed version control design.</p>
<p>Another issue with traditional VCS was that it was difficult to create 
branches. Take a look
<a href="http://www.sci.utah.edu/~macleod/docs/cvs-tips.html">at this tutorial on managing a CVS repository</a>
as an example of the confusion the existing non-distributed models could
cause. Git simplified the branching process with simplified commands 
such as <code>git checkout -b</code> and faster branch merging and clean up. In contrast
to earlier version control systems, Git encourages developers to create local 
branches and experiment in them without impacting a stable <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> also helped to drive Git as the overwhelming
version control favorite by providing the open source community with free open
remote Git repositories. GitHub's web application user interface, issue 
tracking and pull request features for maintainers and consumers also 
encouraged more collaboration than Git alone. Recently, 
<a href="https://github.com/marketplace">GitHub's third-party marketplace</a> has
begun to add more features by integrating 
<a href="/continuous-integration.html">continuous integration</a> servers like 
as <a href="/jenkins.html">Jenkins</a> and <a href="/code-metrics.html">code metrics</a> services.</p>

<h2>Git Workflows</h2>
<p>Teams of developers can use Git in varying workflows because of Git's 
distributed model and lightweight branching. There is no "right way" to 
use Git, especially because development teams can range in size from a
single developer up to entire companies with thousands of developers in
a repository. The only correct answer is to let the developers decide on
a workflow that maximizes their ability to frequently commit code and
minimize merge conflicts.</p>

   <h1>Data</h1>
<p>Data is an incredibly broad topic but it can be broken down into many
subsections, including (in no particular order):</p>
<ul>
<li>data processing / wrangling</li>
<li>machine learning</li>
<li>data analysis</li>
<li><a href="/data-visualization.html">visualization</a></li>

<li>natural language processing (NLP)</li>
<li>indexing, search and retrieval</li>
</ul>
<p>The Python community has built and continues to create open source libraries 
and tutorials for all of the above topics.</p>
<h2>Why is Python a great language choice for data tasks?</h2>
<p>Python has a wide array of open source code libraries available and a
diverse community of people with different backgrounds who contribute to
make those libraries better each day.</p>
<p>In addition, Python data manipulation code can be combined with 
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">web frameworks</a> and
<a href="/application-programming-interfaces.html">web APIs</a> to build software
that would be difficult to create with a single other language. For example,
Ruby is a fantastic language for building web applications but its data
analysis and visualization libraries are very limited compared to what
is currently available in the Python ecosystem.</p>
<h2>How did Python become so widely used for working with data?</h2>
<p>Python is a general purpose programming language and can be applied to
many problem areas. Over the past couple of decades, Python has become 
increasingly popular in the scientific and financial communities. Projects
such as <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> grew out of a hedge-fund while
<a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a> and <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a> were
created in academic environments then improved by the broader open source
community.</p>
<p>The question is: why Python was used to created these projects? The answer
is a mix of luck, the growth of the open source community as Python was
maturing and wide adoption by people not formally trained as computer 
scientists. The pragmatic syntax and explicit style helped very intelligent
people without programming backgrounds to pick up the language and get their
work done with less fuss than other programming languages. Over time the
code used in the financial world and scientific community was shared at the
same time global open source communities were developing, further spreading
their usage among a broader base of software developers.</p>
<p>There's no doubt some of the momentum behind Python's wide adoption for all 
types of data manipulation was that it happened to be the right language in
the right place at the right time. Nevertheless, it was ultimately the hard 
work of a massive number of engineers and scientists around the world who
created the incredible mix of data code libraries available today.</p>

   <h1>Databases</h1>
<p>A database is an abstraction over an 
<a href="/operating-systems.html">operating system</a>'s file system that makes
it easier for developers to build applications that create, read, update
and delete persistent data.</p>
<p><img src="/img/logos/databases.jpg" width="100%" alt="PostgreSQL, SQLite and MySQL logos, copyright their respective owners." class="technical-diagram"  style="border-radius:5px;border:1px solid #999" /></p>
<h2>Why are databases necessary?</h2>
<p>At a high level web applications store data and present it to users in a 
useful way. For example, Google stores data about roads and provides 
directions to get from one location to another by driving through the 
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/">Maps</a> application. Driving directions are 
possible because the data is stored in a structured format. </p>
<p>Databases make structured storage reliable and fast. They also give you a 
mental framework for how the data should be saved and retrieved instead of 
having to figure out what to do with the data every time you build a new 
application.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Databases are a concept with many implementations, including <a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="/mysql.html">MySQL</a> and <a href="/sqlite.html">SQLite</a>. Non-relational databases called <a href="/no-sql-datastore.html">NoSQL data stores</a> also exist.  Learn more in the <a href="/data.html">data</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>Relational databases</h2>
<p>The database storage abstraction most commonly used in Python web development 
is sets of relational tables. Alternative storage abstractions are explained 
on the <a href="/no-sql-datastore.html">NoSQL</a> page.</p>
<p>Relational databases store data in a series of tables. Interconnections
between the tables are specified as <em>foreign keys</em>. A foreign key is a
unique reference from one row in a relational table to another row in
a table, which can be the same table but is most commonly a different table.</p>
<p>Databases storage implementations vary in complexity. SQLite, a database 
included with Python, creates a single file for all data per database. 
Other databases such as <a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a>,
<a href="/mysql.html">MySQL</a>, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server have more 
complicated persistence schemes while offering additional advanced features 
that are useful for web application data storage. These advanced
features include but are not limited to:</p>
<ol>
<li>data replication between a master database and one or more read-only slave 
   instances</li>
<li>advanced column types that can efficiently store semi-structured data
   such as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</li>
<li>sharding, which allows horizontal scaling of multiple databases that 
   each serve as read-write instances at the cost of latency in data
   consistency</li>
<li>monitoring, statistics and other useful runtime information for
   database schemas and tables</li>
</ol>
<p>Typically web applications start with a single database instance such
as PostgreSQL with a straightforward schema. Over time the database 
schema evolves to a more complex structure using schema migrations and 
advanced features such as replication, sharding and monitoring become
more useful as database utilization increases based on the application
users' needs.</p>
<h2>Most common databases for Python web apps</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> and 
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> are two of the most common open source
databases for storing Python web applications' data.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> is a database that is stored in a single
file on disk. SQLite is built into Python but is only built for access
by a single connection at a time. Therefore is highly recommended to not
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/databases/#database-is-locked-errors">run a production web application with SQLite</a>.</p>
<h2>PostgreSQL database</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL is the recommended relational database for working with Python
web applications. PostgreSQL's feature set, active development and stability
contribute to its usage as the backend for millions of applications live
on the Web today.</p>
<p>Learn more about using PostgreSQL with Python on the 
<a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL page</a>.</p>
<h2>MySQL database</h2>
<p>MySQL is another viable open source database implementation for Python 
applications. MySQL has a slightly easier initial learning curve than 
PostgreSQL but is not as feature rich.</p>
<p>Find out about Python applications with a MySQL backed on the dedicated 
<a href="/mysql.html">MySQL page</a>.</p>
<h2>Connecting to a database with Python</h2>
<p>To work with a relational database using Python, you need to use a code 
library. The most common libraries for relational databases are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psycopg2</a> 
  (<a href="https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2">source code</a>)
  for PostgreSQL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/MySQL-python/1.2.5">MySQLdb</a> 
  (<a href="https://github.com/farcepest/MySQLdb1">source code</a>) 
  for MySQL. Note that this driver's development is mostly frozen so
  evaluating alternative drivers is wise if you are using 
  <a href="/mysql.html">MySQL</a> as a backend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/index.html">cx_Oracle</a> for 
  Oracle Database (<a href="https://github.com/oracle/python-cx_Oracle">source code</a>).
  Oracle moved their
  <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/oracle-database-python-driver-now-on-github">open source driver code from SourceForge to GitHub in 2017</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>SQLite support is built into Python 2.7+ and therefore a separate library
is not necessary. Simply "import sqlite3" to begin interfacing with the 
single file-based database.</p>
<h2>Object-relational Mapping</h2>
<p>Object-relational mappers (ORMs) allow developers to access data from a 
backend by writing Python code instead of SQL queries. Each web 
application framework handles integrating ORMs differently. There's 
<a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">an entire page on object-relational mapping</a> 
(ORMs) that you should read to get a handle on this subject.</p>
<h2>Database third-party services</h2>
<p>Numerous companies run scalable database servers as a hosted service.
Hosted databases can often provide automated backups and recovery,
tightened security configurations and easy vertical scaling, depending on the
provider.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://aws.amazon.com/rds/">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a>
  provides pre-configured MySQL and PostgreSQL instances. The instances can
  be scaled to larger or smaller configurations based on storage and performance
  needs.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-sql/">Google Cloud SQL</a> is a service
  with managed, backed up, replicated, and auto-patched MySQL instances. Cloud
  SQL integrates with Google App Engine but can be used independently as well.</p>

  databases with extensive backup services.</p>
</li>
<li>

<h2>Databases learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install PostgreSQL on your server. Assuming you went with Ubuntu run 
   <code>sudo apt-get install postgresql</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure the <a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psycopg2</a> library is in your
   application's dependencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure your web application to connect to the PostgreSQL instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create models in your ORM, either with Django's 
   <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/">built-in ORM</a> or
   <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy with Flask</a>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build your database tables or sync the ORM models with the PostgreSQL 
   instance, if you're using an ORM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start creating, reading, updating and deleting data in the database 
   from your web application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>PostgreSQL</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>, often written as "Postgres" and 
pronounced "Poss-gres", is an open source
<a href="/databases.html">relational database</a> implementation frequently used by 
Python applications as a backend for data storage and retrieval.</p>
<p><img src="/img/logos/postgresql.jpg" width="100%" alt="PostgreSQL logo." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<h2>How does PostgreSQL fit within the Python stack?</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL is the default database choice for many Python developers, 
including the Django team when testing the 
<a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">Django ORM</a>. PostgreSQL is often
viewed as more feature robust and stable when compared to MySQL, SQLServer 
and Oracle. All of those databases are reasonable choices. However, because 
PostgreSQL tends to be used by Python developers the drivers and example
code for using the database tend to be better documented and contain fewer
bugs for typical usage scenarios. If you try to use an Oracle database with
Django, you'll see there is far less example code for that setup compared
to PostgreSQL backend setups.</p>
<div class="well see-also">PostgreSQL is an implementation of the <a href="/databases.html">relational database</a> concept. Learn more in the <a href="/data.html">data</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>Why is PostgreSQL a good database choice?</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL's open source license allows developers to operate one or
more databases without licensing cost in their applications. The open 
source license operating model is much less expensive compared to Oracle 
or other proprietary databases, especially as replication and sharding
become necessary at large scale. In addition, because so many people 
ranging from independent developers to multinational organizations use 
PostgreSQL, it's often easier to find developers with PostgreSQL experience 
than other relational databases. There is also 
<a href="https://blog.2ndquadrant.com/postgresql-better-mysql-1/">ancedotal evidence that PostgreSQL fixes bugs faster than MySQL</a>, 
although to be fair there has not been a comprehensive study comparing
how the two projects handle defect resolution.</p>
<p>The PostgreSQL core team also releases frequent updates that greatly enhance 
the database's capabilities. For example, in the 
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/release-9-4.html">PostgreSQL 9.4 release</a>
the <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/datatype-json.html">jsonb type</a>
was added to enhance JavaScript Object Notation (<a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>)
storage capabilities so that in many cases a separate 
<a href="/no-sql-datastore.html">NoSQL database</a> is not required in an application's
architecture.</p>
<h2>Connecting to PostgreSQL with Python</h2>
<p>To work with relational databases in Python you need to use a database 
driver, which is also referred to as a database connector. The most common 
driver library for working with PostgreSQL is 
<a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psycopg2</a>. There is 
<a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Python">a list of all drivers on the PostgreSQL wiki</a>,
including several libraries that are no longer maintained. If you're
working with the 
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio.html">asyncio Python stdlib module</a> 
you should also take a look at the 
<a href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiopg">aiopg</a> library which
wraps psycopg2's asychronouos features together.</p>
<p>To abstract the connection between tables and objects, many Python 
developers use an 
<a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">object-relational mapper (ORM)</a> with 
to turn relational data from PostgreSQL into objects that can be used in
their Python application. For example, while PostgreSQL provides a 
relational database and psycopg is the common database connector, there
are many ORMs that can be used with varying web frameworks, as shown in the
table below.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/postgresql-orm-examples.png" width="100%" alt="Examples of how varying Python ORMs can work with PostgreSQL and the psycopg2 connector." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>Learn more about 
<a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">Python ORMs on that dedicated topic page</a>.</p>
<h2>PostgreSQL data safety</h2>
<p>If you're on Linux it's easy to get PostgreSQL installed using a package manager.
However, once the database is installed and running your responsibility is just beginning.
Before you go live with a production application, make sure to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lock down access with 
   <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html">a whitelist</a> 
   in the <code>pg_hba.conf</code> file </li>
<li>Enable <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-master-slave-replication-on-postgresql-on-an-ubuntu-12-04-vps">replication</a>
   to another database that's preferrably on different infrastructure in 
   a separate location</li>
<li>Perform regular 
   <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/backup.html">backups and test the restoration process</a></li>
<li>Ensure your application prevents 
   <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection">SQL injection attacks</a></li>

<p>When possible have someone qualified do a 
<a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/2517/postgresql-security-audit">PostgreSQL security audit</a>
to identify the biggest risks to your database. Small applications and 
bootstrapped companies often cannot afford a full audit in the beginning but
as an application grows over time it becomes a bigger target.</p>
<p>The data stored in your database is the lifeblood of your application. If you have
ever 
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/02/introducing-developer-evangelist-matt-makai.html">accidentally dropped a production database</a> 
or been the victim of malicious activity such as SQL injection attacks, you'll
know it's far easier to recover when a bit of work has been performed 
beforehand on backups, replication and security measures.</p>

   <h1>MySQL</h1>
<p>MySQL is an open source <a href="/databases.html">relational database</a> 
implementation for storing and retrieving data.</p>
<p><img src="/img/logos/mysql.png" width="100%" alt="MySQL logo." class="shot"></p>
<h2>MySQL or PostgreSQL?</h2>
<p>MySQL is a viable open source database implementation for Python web 
applications. MySQL has a slightly easier initial learning curve than 
<a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a>. However, PostgreSQL's design is often 
preferred by Python web developers, especially when data migrations are
run as an application evolves.</p>
<div class="well see-also">MySQL is an implementation of the <a href="/databases.html">relational database</a> concept. Learn more in the <a href="/data.html">data</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>Python Drivers for MySQL</h2>
<p>Accessing MySQL from a Python application requires a database driver (also
called a "connector"). While it is possible to write a driver as part of
your application, in practice most developers use an existing open source 
driver.</p>
<p>There was a major issue with MySQL drivers since the introduction of 
Python 3. One of the most popular libraries called 
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/MySQL-python/1.2.5">MySQLdb</a> did not work
in its existing form with Python 3 and there were no plans to update it.
Therefore a fork of MySQLdb named 
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient">mysqlclient</a> added Python 3
compatibility. </p>
<p>The mysqlclient fork was good in that existing MySQLdb users could drop
mysqlclient into existing projects that were upgrading to Python 3. However,
the fork often causes confusion when searching for which Python driver to
use with MySQL. Many developer simply decide to use 
<a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a> because there is better support for Python
drivers in the PostgreSQL community. </p>
<p>With that driver support context in mind, it's absolutely possible to build
a Python 3 web application with MySQL as a backend. Here is a list of
drivers along with whether it supports Python 2, 3 or both.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient">mysqlclient</a> is a fork
  of MySQLdb that supports Python 2 and 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/">MySQL Connector</a>
  is Oracle's "official" (Oracle currently owns MySQL) Python connector.
  The driver supports Python 2 and 3, just make sure to check the 
  <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/">version guide</a> for what
  releases work with which Python versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/MySQL-python/1.2.5">MySQLdb</a> supports
  Python 2 and was frequently used by Python web applications before the
  mass migration to Python 3 began.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL">PyMySQL</a> is a pure Python 
  (no C low-level code) implementation that attempts to be a drop-in
  replacement for MySQLdb. However, some MySQL APIs are not supported
  by the driver so whether or not your application can use this connector
  will depend on what you're building.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What organizations use MySQL?</h2>
<p>The database is deployed in production at some of the highest 
trafficked sites such as 
<a href="https://eng.uber.com/mysql-migration/">Uber</a>,
<a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2012/mysql-twitter">Twitter</a>, 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/mysql-and-database-engineering-mark-callaghan/10150599729938920">Facebook</a>
and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/customers/">many others major organizations</a>.
However, since
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL_AB">MySQL AB</a>, the company that 
developed MySQL, was purchased by Sun Microsystems (which was in turn 
purchased by Oracle), there have been major defections away from the 
database by 
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/wikipedia-moving-from-mysql-to-mariadb-7000008912/">Wikipedia</a> 
and <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/09/14/google-waves-goodbye-to-mysql-in-favor-of-mariadb">Google</a>. 
MySQL remains a viable database option but I always recommend new Python 
developers learn <a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a> if they do not already know 
MySQL.</p>

   <h1>Object-relational mappers (ORMs)</h1>
<p>An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a code library that automates the
transfer of data stored in relational databases tables into objects that
are more commonly used in application code.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/orms-bridge.png" width="100%" alt="Diagram showing how object-relational mappers bridge the database and Python objects." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<h3>Why are ORMs useful?</h3>
<p>ORMs provide a high-level abstraction upon a
<a href="/databases.html">relational database</a> that allows a developer to write
Python code instead of SQL to create, read, update and delete data and
schemas in their database. Developers can use the programming language they
are comfortable with to work with a database instead of writing SQL
statements or stored procedures.</p>
<p>For example, without an ORM a developer would write the following SQL
statement to retrieve every row in the USERS table where the
<code>zip_code</code> column is 94107:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE zip_code=94107;
</pre></div>


<p>The equivalent <a href="/django-orm.html">Django ORM</a> query would instead look like 
the following Python code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># obtain everyone in the 94107 zip code and assign to users variable
users = Users.objects.filter(zip_code=94107)
</pre></div>


<p>The ability to write Python code instead of SQL can speed up web application
development, especially at the beginning of a project. The potential
development speed boost comes from not having to switch from Python code
into writing declarative paradigm SQL statements. While some software
developers may not mind switching back and forth between languages, it's
typically easier to knock out a prototype or start a web application using
a single programming language.</p>
<p>ORMs also make it theoretically possible to switch an application between
various relational databases. For example, a developer could use 
<a href="/sqlite.html">SQLite</a> for
local development and <a href="/mysql.html">MySQL</a> in production. A production 
application could be switched from MySQL to <a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a> with 
minimal code modifications.</p>
<p>In practice however, it's best to use the same database for local development
as is used in production. Otherwise unexpected errors could hit in production
that were not seen in a local development environment. Also, it's rare that
a project would switch from one database in production to another one unless
there was a pressing reason.</p>
<div class="well see-also">While you're learning about ORMs you should also read up on <a href="/deployment.html">deployment</a> and check out the <a href="/application-dependencies.html">application dependencies</a> page.</div>

<h2>Do I have to use an ORM for my web application?</h2>
<p>Python ORM libraries are not required for accessing relational
databases. In fact, the low-level access is typically provided by another
library called a <em>database connector</em>, such as
<a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psycopg</a> (for PostgreSQL)
or <a href="https://pypi.org/project/MySQL-python/1.2.5">MySQL-python</a> (for
MySQL). Take a look at the table below which shows how ORMs can work with
different web frameworks and connectors and relational databases.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/orm-examples.png" width="100%" alt="Examples of how varying Python ORMs can work with different connectors and backends." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>The above table shows for example that SQLAlchemy can work with varying
web frameworks and database connectors. Developers can also use ORMs without
a web framework, such as when creating a data analysis tool or a batch
script without a user interface.</p>
<h2>What are the downsides of using an ORM?</h2>
<p>There are numerous downsides of ORMs, including</p>
<ol>
<li>Impedance mismatch</li>
<li>Potential for reduced performance</li>
<li>Shifting complexity from the database into the application code</li>
</ol>
<h3>Impedance mismatch</h3>
<p>The phrase "impedance mismatch" is commonly used in conjunction with ORMs.
Impedance mismatch is a catch-all term for the difficulties that occur when
moving data between relational tables and application objects. The gist
is that the way a developer uses objects is different from how data is
stored and joined in relational tables.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/impedanceMismatch.html">This article on ORM impedance mismatch</a>
does a solid job of explaing what the concept is at a high level and
provides diagrams to visualize why the problem occurs.</p>
<h3>Potential for reduced performance</h3>
<p>One of the concerns that's associated with any higher-level abstraction or
framework is potential for reduced performance. With ORMs, the performance
hit comes from the translation of application code into a corresponding SQL
statement which may not be tuned properly.</p>
<p>ORMs are also often easy to try but difficult to master. For example, a
beginner using Django might not know about the
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/models/querysets/#select-related"><code>select_related()</code> function</a>
and how it can improve some queries' foreign key relationship performance.
There are dozens of performance tips and tricks for every ORM. It's possible
that investing time in learning those quirks may be better spent just
learning SQL and how to write stored procedures.</p>
<p>There's a lot of hand-waving "may or may not" and "potential for" in this
section. In large projects ORMs are good enough for roughly 80-90% of use
cases but in 10-20% of a project's database interactions there can be
major performance improvements by having a knowledgeable database
administrator write tuned SQL statements to replace the ORM's generated
SQL code.</p>
<h3>Shifting complexity from the database into the app code</h3>
<p>The code for working with an application's data has to live somewhere. Before
ORMs were common, database stored procedures were used to encapsulate the
database logic. With an ORM, the data manipulation code instead lives within
the application's Python codebase. The addition of data handling logic in the
codebase generally isn't an issue with a sound application design, but it does
increase the total amount of Python code instead of splitting code between
the application and the database stored procedures.</p>
<h2>Python ORM Implementations</h2>
<p>There are numerous ORM implementations written in Python, including</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/sqlalchemy.html">SQLAlchemy</a></li>
<li><a href="/peewee.html">Peewee</a></li>
<li><a href="/django-orm.html">The Django ORM</a></li>
<li><a href="/pony-orm.html">PonyORM</a></li>
<li><a href="http://sqlobject.org/">SQLObject</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tortoise-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Tortoise ORM</a></li>
</ol>
<p>There are other ORMs, such as Canonical's
<a href="https://storm.canonical.com/">Storm</a>, but most of them do not appear to
currently be under active development. Learn more about the major active
ORMs below.</p>
<h3>Django's ORM</h3>
<p>The <a href="/django.html">Django</a> web framework comes with
<a href="/django-orm.html">its own built-in object-relational mapping module</a>, 
generally referred to as "the Django ORM" or "Django's ORM".</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/db/">Django's ORM</a> works well
for simple and medium-complexity database operations. However, there are often
complaints that the ORM makes complex queries much more complicated than
writing straight SQL or using <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>.</p>
<p>It is technically possible to drop down to SQL but it ties the queries to a
specific database implementation. The ORM is coupled closely with Django so
replacing the default ORM with SQLAlchemy is currently a hack workaround. 
Note though it is possible that swappable ORM backends will be possible
in the future as it is now possible to change the 
<a href="/template-engines.html">template engine</a> for rendering output in Django.</p>
<p>Since the majority of Django projects are tied to the default ORM, it is 
best to read up on advanced use cases and tools for doing your best work 
within the existing framework.</p>
<h3>SQLAlchemy ORM</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> is a well-regarded
Python ORM because it gets the abstraction level "just right" and
seems to make complex database queries easier to write than the Django
ORM in most cases. There is <a href="/sqlalchemy.html">an entire page on SQLAlchemy</a> 
that you should read if you want to learn more about using the library.</p>
<h3>Peewee ORM</h3>
<p><a href="https://peewee.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Peewee</a> is a Python ORM
implementation that is written to be
"<a href="http://charlesleifer.com/blog/the-case-for-peewee-small-hackable-and-fun/">simpler, smaller and more hackable</a>"
than SQLAlchemy. Read the <a href="/peewee.html">full Peewee page</a> for more 
information on the Python ORM implementation.</p>
<h3>Pony</h3>
<p><a href="http://ponyorm.com/">Pony ORM</a> is another Python ORM available as 
open source, under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>
<h3>SQLObject ORM</h3>
<p><a href="http://sqlobject.org/">SQLObject</a> is an ORM that has been under active
open source development for over 14 years, since
<a href="http://sqlobject.org/News1.html#sqlobject-0-5">before 2003</a>.</p>
<h2>Schema migrations</h2>
<p>Schema migrations, for example when you need to add a new column to an
existing table in your database, are not technically part of ORMs. However,
since ORMs typically lead to a hands-off approach to the database (at the
developers peril in many cases), libraries to perform schema migrations
often go hand-in-hand with Python ORM usage on web application projects.</p>
<p>Database schema migrations are a complex topic and deserve their own page.
For now, we'll lump schema migration resources under ORM links below.</p>
<h3>General ORM resources</h3>

  benefits to developers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://maetl.net/talks/rise-and-fall-of-orm">The Rise and Fall of Object Relational Mapping</a>

  controversy. Overall I found the critique of conceptual ideas worth
  the time it took to read the presentation slides and companion text.</p>

<p>If you're confused about the difference between a connector, such as
  MySQL-python and an ORM like SQLAlchemy, read this

<p><a href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/2014/08/03/What-ORMs-have-taught-me-just-learn-SQL/index.html">What ORMs have taught me: just learn SQL</a>
  is another angle in the ORM versus embedded SQL / stored procedures debate.
  The author's conclusion is that while working with ORMs such as SQLAlchemy
  and Hibernate (a Java-based ORM) can save time up front there are issues
  as a project evolves such as partial objects and schema redundancies.
  I think the author makes some valid points that some ORMs can be a shaky
  foundation for extremely complicated database-backed applications. However,
  I disagree with the overriding conclusion to eschew ORMs in favor of
  stored procedures. Stored procedures have their own issues and there are
  no perfect solutions, but I personally prefer using an ORM at the start
  of almost every project even if it later needs to be replaced with
  direct SQL queries.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/">The Vietnam of Computer Science</a> 
  provides the perspective from Ted Neward, the originator of the phrase
  "Object/relational mapping is the Vietnam of Computer Science" that he
  first spoke about in 2004. The gist of the argument against ORMs is 
  captured in Ted's quote that an ORM "represents a quagmire which starts 
  well, gets more complicated as time passes, and before long entraps its 
  users in a commitment that has no clear demarcation point, no clear 
  win conditions, and no clear exit strategy." There are follow up posts on 
  <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/object-relational-mapping-is-the-vietnam-of-computer-science/">Coding Horror</a>

  coins the funny but insightful phrase "database denial" to describe how
  some ORMs provide a usage model that can cause more issues than they
  solve over straight SQL queries. The post then goes into much more detail
  about the problems that can arise and how to mitigate or avoid them.</p>

   <h1>SQLAlchemy</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> 
(<a href="https://github.com/zzzeek/sqlalchemy">source code</a>) is a well-regarded 
database toolkit and 
<a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">object-relational mapper (ORM)</a>
implementation written in Python. SQLAlchemy provides a generalized 
interface for creating and executing database-agnostic code without 
needing to write SQL statements.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/"><img src="/img/logos/sqlalchemy.jpg" width="100%" alt="SQLAlchemy logo." class="shot"></a></p>
<h2>Why is SQLAlchemy a good ORM choice?</h2>
<p>SQLAlchemy isn't just an ORM- it also provides SQLAlchemy Core for performing
database work that is abstracted from the implementation differences between 
PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc. In some ways, the ORM is a bonus to Core that
automates commonly-required create, read, update and delete operations.</p>
<p>SQLAlchemy can be used with or without the ORM features. Any given project 
can choose to just use SQLAlchemy Core or both Core and the ORM. The 
following diagram shows a few example configurations with various 
application software stacks and backend databases. Any of these 
configurations can be a valid option depending on what type of application
you are coding.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/sqlalchemy-orm-example.png" width="100%" alt="Example SQLAlchemy configurations with different web frameworks." class="shot"></a></p>
<p>A benefit many developers enjoy with SQLAlchemy is that it allows them 
to write Python code in their project to map from the database schema 
to the applications' Python objects. No SQL is required to create, 
maintain and query the database. The mapping allows SQLAlchemy to handle 
the underlying database so developers can work with their Python objects 
instead of writing bridge code to get data in and out of relational tables.</p>
<div class="well see-also">SQLAlchemy is an implementation of the <a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">object-relational mapping (ORM)</a> concept. Learn more in the <a href="/data.html">data</a> chapter or view <a href="/table-of-contents.html">all topics</a>.</div>

<h2>How does SQLAlchemy code compare to raw SQL?</h2>
<p>Below is an example of a SQLAlchemy model definition from the open source 
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/compare-python-web-frameworks/blob/master/flask_jinja_sqlalchemy/app.py">compare-python-web-frameworks project</a>
that uses SQLAlchemy with Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kr">class</span> <span class="nx">Contact</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">db</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Model</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span>

</pre></div>


<p>SQLAlchemy handles the table creation that otherwise we would have had
to write a create table statement like this one to do the work:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>CREATE TABLE CONTACTS(
   ID INT PRIMARY KEY        NOT NULL,
   FIRST_NAME     CHAR(100)  NOT NULL,
   LAST_NAME      CHAR(100)  NOT NULL,
   PHONE_NUMBER   CHAR(32)   NOT NULL,
);
</pre></div>


<p>By using SQLAlchemy in our Python code, all records can be obtained with a 
line like <code>contacts = Contact.query.all()</code> instead of a plain SQL such as 
<code>SELECT * FROM contacts</code>. That may not look like much of a difference in
syntax but writing the queries in Python is often faster and easier for
many Python developers once multiple tables and specific filtering on fields 
for queries have to be written. In addition, SQLAlchemy abstracts away
idiosyncratic differences between database implementations in 
<a href="/sqlite.html">SQLite</a>, <a href="/mysql.html">MySQL</a> and 
<a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a>.</p>
<h3>Using SQLAlchemy with Web Frameworks</h3>
<p>There is no reason why you cannot use the SQLAlchemy library in any 
application that requires a database backend. However, if you are
building a web app with <a href="/flask.html">Flask</a>, <a href="/bottle.html">Bottle</a> or 
<a href="/other-web-frameworks.html">another web framework</a> then take
a look at the following extensions. They provide some glue code along with
helper functions that can reduce the boilerplate code needed to connect
your application's code with the SQLAlchemy library.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>SQLAlchemy is typically used with Flask as the database
  ORM via the <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/">Flask-SQLAlchemy</a>
  extension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/iurisilvio/bottle-sqlalchemy">bottle-sqlalchemy</a>
  extension for <a href="/bottle.html">Bottle</a> provides a bridge between the standard
  SQLAlchemy library and Bottle. However, from my experience using the library
  it does not have quite as many helper functions as Flask-SQLAlchemy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/pyramid.html">Pyramid</a> uses the 
  <a href="http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid_cookbook/en/latest/database/sqlalchemy.html">alchemy scaffold</a>
  to make it easy to add SQLAlchemy to a Pyramid web app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While <a href="/django.html">Django</a> does not yet support easy swapping of the 
  default Django backend ORM with SQLAlchemy (like it does for 
  <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/settings/#std:setting-TEMPLATES">template engines</a>),

<h3>SQLAlchemy resources</h3>
<p>The best way to get comfortable with SQLAlchemy is to dig in and write
a database-driven application. The following resources can be helpful if 
you are having trouble getting started or are starting to run into some 
edge cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is an entire chapter in the 
  <a href="http://aosabook.org/en/sqlalchemy.html">Architecture of Open Source Applications book on SQLAlchemy</a>.
  The content is detailed and well worth reading to understand what is 
  executing under the covers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 
  <a href="https://github.com/crazyguitar/pysheeet/blob/master/docs/notes/python-sqlalchemy.rst">SQLAlchemy cheatsheet</a>

  other common (and not so common) operations when working with Core and 
  the ORM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://pajhome.org.uk/blog/10_reasons_to_love_sqlalchemy.html">10 reasons to love SQLAlchemy</a>
  is a bit of a non-critical lovefest for the code library. However, the
  post makes some good points about the quality of SQLAlchemy's 
  documentation and what a pleasure it can be to use it in a Python project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://engineering.betterworks.com/2015/09/03/sqlalchemy-and-django/">SQLAlchemy and Django</a>
  explains how one development team uses the Django ORM for most of their
  standard queries but relies on SQLAlchemy for really advanced queries.</p>
</li>

  project's history and how it has evolved over the past decade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most Flask developers use SQLAlchemy as an ORM to relational databases.
  If you're unfamiliar with SQLAlchemy questions will often come up such as
  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4201455/sqlalchemy-whats-the-difference-between-flush-and-commit">what's the difference between flush and commit?</a>

</ul>
<h3>SQLAlchemy compared to other ORMs</h3>
<p>SQLAlchemy is one of many 
<a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">Python object-relational mapper (ORM)</a>
implementations. Several open source projects and articles are listed here 
to make it a bit easier to understand the differences between these
implementations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.pythoncentral.io/sqlalchemy-vs-orms/">SQLAlchemy vs Other ORMs</a>
  provides a detailed comparison of SQLAlchemy against alternatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're interested in the differences between SQLAlchemy and the Django
  ORM I recommend reading
  <a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2011/7/19/sqlachemy-and-you/">SQLAlchemy and You</a>
  by Armin Ronacher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This 
  <a href="https://github.com/sloria/PythonORMSleepy">GitHub project named PythonORMSleepy</a> 
  implements the same Flask application with several different ORMs:
  SQLAlchemy, Peewee, MongoEngine, stdnet and PonyORM. Looking through the
  code is helpful for understanding the varying approaches each library
  takes to accomplish a similar objective. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quora has several answers to the question of 
  <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-is-better-and-why-Djangos-ORM-or-SQLAlchemy">which is better and why: Django ORM or SQLALchemy</a>
  based on various developers' experiences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
   <h1>Peewee</h1>
<p><a href="http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/">Peewee</a> 
(<a href="https://github.com/coleifer/peewee">source code</a>) is a 
<a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">object-relational mapper (ORM)</a> 
implementation for bridging data stored in
<a href="/databases.html">relational database tables</a> with Python objects.</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/"><img src="/img/logos/peewee.png" width="100%" alt="Peewee logo." class="technical-diagram"></a></p>
<h2>What makes Peewee a useful ORM?</h2>
<p>Peewee can be an easier library to wrap your head around than SQLAlchemy
and other ORMs. It is designed to be easier to hack on and understand, 
similar to how <a href="/bottle.html">Bottle</a> is a smaller, one-file 
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">web framework</a> compared to the comprehensive 
<a href="/django.html">Django</a> framework. If you are just getting started with
web development, it may be worth using Peewee for your database mapping
and operations, especially if you use a microframework such as Flask or
Bottle.</p>
<p>Peewee can be used with pretty much any web framework (although using it
with <a href="/django.html">Django</a> would currently be complicated due to its 
tight built-in ORM coupling) or without a web framework. In the latter 
case Peewee is good for pulling data out of a relational database in a
script or Jupyter notebook. </p>
<p>Any of the common relational database backends such as 
<a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="/mysql.html">MySQL</a> or 
<a href="/sqlite.html">SQLite</a> are supported, although a database driver is
still required. The chart below shows a few example configurations
that could use Peewee as an ORM.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/peewee-orm-example.png" width="100%" alt="Example Peewee configurations with different web frameworks." class="technical-diagram"></a></p>
<div class="well see-also">Peewee is an implementation of the <a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">object-relational mapping (ORM)</a> concept. Learn more in the <a href="/data.html">data</a> chapter or view <a href="/table-of-contents.html">all topics</a>.</div>

<h2>How does Peewee compare to other Python ORMs?</h2>
<p>The analogy used by the core Peewee author is that Peewee
is to <a href="/sqlalchemy.html">SQLAlchemy</a> as <a href="/sqlite.html">SQLite</a> is to 
<a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a>. An 
<a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">ORM</a> does not have to work for 
every exhaustive use case in order to be useful.</p>
<h3>Peewee resources</h3>
<p>Peewee is a much newer library than several other Python ORMs.
For example, Peewee's <a href="https://github.com/coleifer/peewee/commit/4fd56bd35c27861337861233a7f362474157af57">first public commit was in 2010</a>, 
compared to 
<a href="https://github.com/zzzeek/sqlalchemy/commit/ec052c6a1f1fb0236bd367c510d82f076cb67bc9">2005 for SQLAlchemy</a>.
The project is still over five years old though and matured substantially
in development during that time. However, there are typically less resources
and examples available to demonstrate how to use Peewee in your projects
than some other ORMs that have been around for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Many of the best resources come from the project's author, Charles Leifer,
on his blog and on the official site. There are also hundreds of questions 
answered on the 
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/peewee">Stack Overflow peewee tag</a>,
so as usual that can be a rich source of examples for your Peewee-powered
Python applications.</p>

   <h1>NoSQL Data Stores</h1>
<p>Relational databases store the vast majority of web application
persistent data. However, there are several alternative classifications of
storage representations.</p>
<ol>
<li>Key-value pair</li>
<li>Document-oriented</li>
<li>Column-family table</li>
<li>Graph</li>
</ol>
<p>These persistent data storage representations are commonly used to augment,
rather than completely replace, relational databases. The underlying
persistence type used by the NoSQL database often gives it different
performance characteristics than a relational database, with better results
on some types of read/writes and worse performance on others.</p>
<h2>Key-value Pair</h2>
<p>Key-value pair data stores are based

<h2>Column-family table</h2>
<p>A column-family table class of NoSQL data stores builds on the key-value
pair type. Each key-value pair is considered a row in the store while the
column family is similar to a table in the relational database model.</p>
<h3>Column-family table data stores</h3>

</ul>
<h2>Graph</h2>
<p>A graph database represents and stores data in three aspects: nodes, edges
and properties.</p>
<p>A <em>node</em> is an entity, such as a person or business.</p>
<p>An <em>edge</em> is the relationship between two entities. For example, an
edge could represent that a node for a person entity is an employee of a
business entity.</p>
<p>A <em>property</em> represents information about nodes. For example, an entity
representing a person could have a property of "female" or "male".</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>NoSQL data stores learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Understand why NoSQL data stores are better for some use cases than
   relational databases. In general these benefits are only seen at large
   scale so they may not be applicable to your web application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate Redis into your project for a speed boost over slower persistent
   storage. Storing session data in memory is generally much faster than
   saving that data in a traditional relational database that uses persistent
   storage. Note that when memory is flushed the data goes away so anything
   that needs to be persistent must still be backed up to disk on a regular
   basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate other use cases such as storing transient logs in a
   document-oriented data store such as MongoDB.</p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>Redis</h1>
<p><a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a> is an in-memory key-value pair 
database typically classified as a <a href="/no-sql-datastore.html">NoSQL database</a>. 
Redis is commonly used for <a href="/caching.html">caching</a>, transient data storage
and as a holding area for data during analysis in Python applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://redis.io/" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/logos/redis.jpg" width="100%" alt="Redis logo." class="shot" /></a></p>

<h3>Redis tutorials</h3>
<p>Redis is easy to install and start using compared to most other persistent
backends, but it's useful to follow a walkthrough if you have never 
previously used Redis or any NoSQL data store.</p>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Redis tools and examples</h3>
<p>Redis' wide applicability can be a downside if you don't know what to start
using it for in your application. The following code and posts provide common
use cases for Redis.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Altoros/redis-labs-use-cases">redis-labs-use-cases</a>
  has a couple of examples of using Redis to analyze geospatial data and
  tweets.</p>

  JSON files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Redis Security</h3>
<p>Redis should be customized out of its default configuration to secure it
against unauthorized and unauthenticated users. These resources provide
some advice on Reids security and guarding against data breaches.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://averagesecurityguy.info/2015/09/17/pentesting-redis-servers/">Pentesting Redis servers</a>
  shows that security is important not only on your application but also
  the databases you're using as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Redis, just as with any relational or NoSQL database, needs to be secured
  based on <a href="http://www.antirez.com/news/96">security guidelines</a>. There is
  also a post where the main author of Redis
  <a href="http://www.antirez.com/news/96">cracks its security</a> to show the tradeoffs
  purposely made between ease of use and security in the default settings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@shahinism/for-gods-sake-secure-your-mongo-redis-etc-4f310cf1bed2">For God’s sake, secure your Mongo/Redis/etc!</a>
  digs into the unfortunate default security settings that come with many
  NoSQL databases which can be used to compromise your systems. Make sure
  to not only install your dependencies such as Redis, but automate modifying
  default settings to lock them down against attackers.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Python with Cassandra resources</h2>
<p>Cassandra is commonly used with Python for write-heavy application demands.
The following tutorials walk through several of the helper libraries that
can be used to interact with Cassandra, with and without web frameworks such
as <a href="/django.html">Django</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://datastax.github.io/python-driver/">DataStax's Python Cassandra driver</a>
  can be installed as an 
  <a href="/application-dependencies.html">application dependency</a> to make it
  easier to access and work with Cassandra in your Python applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://rustyrazorblade.com/2016/02/async-python-and-cassandra-with-gevent/">Async Python and Cassandra with Gevent</a>
  explains how you monkeypatch <a href="http://www.gevent.org/">gevent</a> into 
  a Python 2.7 application and work with Cassandra using gevent's coroutines.
  Note that this post could have instead been written with 
  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">asycnio</a> if it were
  coded with Python 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.slothparadise.com/how-to-install-and-use-cassandra-on-django/">How to Install and Use Cassandra on Django</a>
  instructs how to use Cassandra with Django 1.8 but it should still be
  relevant for newer Django versions as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://blog.turret.io/using-cassandra-with-python-and-uwsgi/">Using Cassandra with Python and uWSGI</a>
  gives some short example code for connecting to a Cassandra cluster outside
  the HTTP request-response cycle to prevent timeouts and blocking issues with
  <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI servers</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Stack Overflow thread asking about the 
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10430417/best-cassandra-library-wrapper-for-python">best Cassandra library/driver for Python?</a>
  has a good answer on why to use the 
  <a href="https://github.com/datastax/python-driver">datastax/python-driver</a>
  project due to its CQL support and active development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rhye.org/post/python-cassandra-namedtuple-performance/">Cassandra performance in Python: Avoid namedtuple</a>
  covers the performance penalty of using the <code>namedtuple</code> type with the
  DataStax Cassandra Python driver and how you can work around it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Companies Use Cassandra</h2>
<p>These resources are written by engineering teams at organizations that
have large scale Cassandra deployments. The posts cover topics such as
monitoring, scaling and usage with billions of records.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blog.discordapp.com/how-discord-stores-billions-of-messages-7fa6ec7ee4c7">How Discord Stores Billions of Messages</a>
  talks about the evolution of Discord's very large scale message store
  system from a <a href="/mongodb.html">MongoDB</a> instance to Cassandra for storing 
  messages in a distributed, replicated cluster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2016/06/monitoring-cassandra-at-scale.html">Monitoring Cassandra at Scale</a>
  explains how the Yelp engineering team uses Cassandra to complement their 
  MySQL and ElasticSearch instances. The post does a nice job of enumerating
  the warning signs to monitor and provides a short example of an issue with
  replication that could be caught by their approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2016/9/28/how-uber-manages-a-million-writes-per-second-using-mesos-and.html">How Uber Manages A Million Writes Per Second Using Mesos And Cassandra Across Multiple Datacenters </a>
  shows why Uber needs accurate real-time data at large scale to make their
  driver and passenger operations run properly. The post goes into the
  overall architecture they use including cluster size, tolerable latency
  and other libraries in their stack.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>General Cassandra resources</h2>
<p>Apache Cassandra can be used independently of Python applications for
data storage and querying. The learning curve for getting started is similar
to other <a href="/no-sql-datastore.html">NoSQL data stores</a> but scaling, performance
and monitoring can be challenging. The following resources focus on addressing
those issues based on teams that have felt the pain and often released their
resulting tools as open source projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The official 
  <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/getting_started/index.html">getting started documentation for Cassandra</a> 
  provides installation, configuration, and basic querying information.</p>
</li>
<li>

  gives examples in Cassandra's query language CQL of operations that are 
  typical with <a href="/databases.html">relational databases</a> but go <em>terribly</em> wrong
  with Cassandra, due to its NoSQL architecture that is optimized for other
  types of operations.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/when-to-use-cassandra-and-when-to-steer-clear-72b7f2cede76">When to use Cassandra and when to steer clear</a>
  explains the advantages Cassandra provides such as high throughput on
  writes (versus reads) and availability. The disadvantages are also
  given such as strong consistency, typical relational database-style
  (ACID) transactions and reads without knowing the primary key of the 
  record you want to access. These are common database tradeoffs you need
  to understand based on your workload and decide upon <em>before</em> you build 
  out your whole data architecture!</p>

   <h1>Bokeh</h1>
<p><a href="https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/">Bokeh</a> is a data visualization
library that allows a developer to code in Python and output 
<a href="/javascript.html">JavaScript</a> charts and visuals in web browsers.</p>
<p><img src="/img/logos/bokeh.jpg" width="100%" alt="Bokeh logo on a dark background." class="shot rnd outl"></p>
<h2>Why is Bokeh a useful library?</h2>
<p>Web browsers are ideal clients for consuming interactive visualizations.
However, libraries such as <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3.js</a> can be
difficult to learn and time consuming to connect to your Python backend
web app. Bokeh instead generates the JavaScript for your application while
you write all your code in Python. The removal of context switching between
the two programming languages can make it easier and faster to create 
charts and visualizations. </p>
<h2>What do Bokeh visualizations look like?</h2>
<p>Bokeh can create any type of custom graph or visualization. For example,
here is a screenshot of a bar chart created with the 
<a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/reference/plotting.html">figure</a>
plot:</p>
<p><img src="/img/170526-bar-charts-bokeh-flask/chart-example-64.png" width="100%" class="shot img rnd" alt="Responsive Bokeh bar chart with 64 bars."></p>

  easiest time if you already understand <a href="/javascript.html">JavaScript</a>,
  SVG and the browser Document Object Model (DOM). Non-technical designers

   <h1>Markup Languages</h1>
<p>Markup languages provide pre-defined, parsable syntax within text documents 
that is used for annotations. For example, within a <a href="/markdown.html">Markdown</a>
document, the syntax 
<code>[this is a link to Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com)</code>
indicates the text "this is a link to Full Stack Python" should be annotated
with a link to "https://www.fullstackpython.com/" when run through a Markdown 
parser and then transformed into HTML output.</p>
<h3>Markup language resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>

</ul>
   <h1>Markdown</h1>
<p>Markdown is a common markup language frequently used by developers to write 
Python project documention.</p>
<p><img src="/img/logos/markdown.png" width="100%" alt="Unofficial Markdown logo."></p>
<h2>Markdown's origin</h2>
<p>Markdown was originally 
<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">developed by John Gruber</a>
in 2004. The markup language's lightweight design helped it gain rapid
adoption by software developers and designers. The format's simplicity also
makes it easier to write parsers to convert the structured syntax into
other formats such as HTML and JSON.</p>
<h2>Markdown resources</h2>
<p>Markdown does not have an extensive set of strict rules like some other
text formats so you should be able to read up on the basics with these
articles then write a few practice documents to be comfortable with it.
The following resources are really helpful when you are getting started
or need a quick reference on a less commonly-used feature such as tables
or block quotes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@drodil/say-yes-to-markdown-no-to-ms-word-be4692e7a8cd">Say yes to Markdown, no to MS Word</a>
  provides a really awesome overview of why Markdown is a more usable file
  format than Microsoft Word and similar proprietary file types. The article
  also has a good list of useful Markdown-related tools such as a 
  <a href="https://github.com/alanshaw/markdown-pdf">Markdown-to-PDF converter</a>
  (a NodeJS package but easy enough to use with a basic development 
  environment).</p>

<p><a href="http://lepture.com/en/2014/markdown-parsers-in-python">Markdown parsers in Python</a>
  reviews many of the most common Python Markdown parser implementations
  to give insight into the advantages and disadvantages of each one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://zverovich.net/2016/06/16/rst-vs-markdown.html">reStructuredText vs Markdown for documentation</a>
  brings up some really good points about the downsides to Markdown's
  simplicity. First, a lot of documentation needs more complex output that
  is not possible with vanilla Markdown so you need to drop into plain old
  HTML, which defeats the purpose of using a markup language. Second, some
  of the syntax around inserting blank lines by adding spaces at the end
  of lines is confusing if someone is using a 
  <a href="/text-editors-ides.html">text editor or development environment</a> that
  is not configured to show blank spaces. Worse yet, if your editor is set to
  remove blank spaces at the end of lines, which is fairly common among
  developers, then you can mistakenly break the formatting intended by 
  the original author. Overall this is a good piece to read for a balanced
  view of Markdown and the reasons it provides are one reason why I use
  both Markdown and reStructuredText depending on the project.</p>

   <h1>Web Development</h1>
<p>Web development is the umbrella term for conceptualizing, creating, 
<a href="/deployment.html">deploying</a> and operating web applications and 
<a href="/application-programming-interfaces.html">application programming interfaces</a>
for the Web.</p>
<h2>Why is web development important?</h2>
<p>The Web has grown a mindboggling amount in the number of sites, users and
implementation capabilities since the 
<a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">first website</a> went live
in <a href="http://home.cern/topics/birth-web">1989</a>. Web development is the concept
that encompasses all the activities involved with websites and web 
applications.</p>
<h2>How does Python fit into web development?</h2>
<p>Python can be used to build server-side web applications. While a
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">web framework</a> is not required to build web apps,
it's rare that developers would not use existing open source libraries to
speed up their progress in getting their application working.</p>
<p>Python is not used in a web browser. The language executed in browsers
such as Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer is 
<a href="/javascript.html">JavaScript</a>. Projects such as <a href="http://pyjs.org/">pyjs</a> 
can compile from Python to JavaScript. However, most Python developers 
write their web applications using a combination of Python and JavaScript.
Python is executed on the server side while JavaScript is downloaded to
the client and run by the web browser.</p>
<h3>Web development resources</h3>
<p>To become an experienced web developer you need to know the foundation
principles that the web is built with, such as HTTP requests and responses,
client (typically web browsers) and server (<a href="/web-servers.html">web servers</a> 
such as <a href="/nginx.html">Nginx</a> and <a href="/apache-http-server.html">Apache</a> 
architectures, <a href="/hypertext-markup-language-html.html">HTML</a>, 
<a href="/cascading-style-sheets.html">CSS</a> and <a href="/javascript.html">JavaScript</a>, among
many other topics. The following resources provide a range of perspectives
and when combined together should get you oriented in the web development
world.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://thesquareplanet.com/blog/how-the-internet-works/">How the Internet works</a>
  is a must-read to get a quick overview of all the pieces that go into
  a network connection from one machine to another. The example explains how
  an email is sent and the story is just as useful for learning about other
  connections such as downloading a webpage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to be a web developer it's important to know the foundational
  tools used to build websites and web applications. It is also important to
  understand that the core concepts such as 
  HTTP, URLs and <a href="/hypertext-markup-language-html.html">HTML</a> were all there
  at the beginning and then were expanded with new specifications over time.
  This article on the
  <a href="https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/">History of the Web</a>
  succinctly explains the origins of the web starting from Tim Berners-Lee's
  origin vision and release at CERN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://engineering.videoblocks.com/web-architecture-101-a3224e126947">Web Architecture 101</a>
  is a great high-level overview of the technologies that run the modern
  web, such as DNS, load balancers, web application servers (for Python
  that equates to <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI servers</a>), 
  <a href="/databases.html">data bases</a>, <a href="/task-queues.html">task queues</a>,
  <a href="/caching.html">caching</a> and several other critical concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com/">Evolution of the Web</a> visualizes 
  how web browsers and related technologies have changed over time as well as
  the overall growth of the Internet in the amount of data transferred. Note 
  that the visualization unfortunately stops around the beginning of 2013 but
  it's a good way to explore what happened in the first 24 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/">How browsers work</a>
  provides an overview with solid detail on how browsers take the HTML,
  CSS, JavaScript, images and other files as input and render webpages as
  output. It is well worth your time to know this stuff as a web developer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://dhilipsiva.com/webapp-checklist/">Web app checklist</a> presents 
  good practices that developers building and <a href="/deployment.html">deploying</a> 
  web applications should follow. Don't worry about having every single
  one of these recommendations implemented before getting your site
  live, but it is worthwhile to review the list to make sure there is not
  something obvious you can handle in a few minutes that will improve
  your site's security, performance or usability.</p>

   <h1>Web frameworks</h1>
<p>A web framework is a code library that makes 
<a href="/web-development.html">web development</a> faster and easier by providing 
common patterns for building reliable, scalable and maintainable web
applications. After the early 2000s, professional web development projects
always use an existing web framework except in very unusual situations.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/web-frameworks.jpg" width="100%" alt="Django, Bottle, Flask, Pyramid, Falcon and Sanic logos, copyright their respective owners." class="shot rnd outl"></p>
<h3>Why are web frameworks useful?</h3>
<p>Web frameworks encapsulate what developers have learned over the past twenty
years while programming sites and applications for the web. Frameworks make 
it easier to reuse code for common HTTP operations and to structure projects 
so other developers with knowledge of the framework can quickly build and
maintain the application.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Web frameworks are a concept implemented by <a href="/django.html">Django</a>, <a href="/flask.html">Flask</a>, <a href="/bottle.html">Bottle</a>, <a href="/pyramid.html">Pyramid</a>, <a href="/morepath.html">Morepath</a>, <a href="/turbogears.html">TurboGears</a> and <a href="/other-web-frameworks.html">several other libraries</a>. Learn how the parts fit together in the <a href="/web-development.html">web development</a> chapter or view <a href="/table-of-contents.html">all topics</a>.</div>

<h3>Common web framework functionality</h3>
<p>Frameworks provide functionality in their code or through extensions to 
perform common operations required to run web applications. These common 
operations include:</p>
<ol>
<li>URL routing</li>
<li>Input form handling and validation</li>
<li><a href="/hypertext-markup-language-html.html">HTML</a>, XML, JSON, and other output 
   formats with a <a href="/template-engines.html">templating engine</a></li>
<li>Database connection configuration and persistent data manipulation through
   an <a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">object-relational mapper (ORM)</a></li>
<li><a href="/web-application-security.html">Web security</a> against 
   Cross-site request forgery (CSRF), SQL Injection, 
   Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and other common malicious attacks</li>
<li>Session storage and retrieval</li>
</ol>
<p>Not all web frameworks include code for all of the above functionality. 
Frameworks fall on the spectrum from executing a single use case to providing 
every known web framework feature to every developer. Some frameworks take 
the "batteries-included" approach where everything possible comes bundled 
with the framework while others have a minimal core package that is amenable
to extensions provided by other packages.</p>
<p>For example, the <a href="/django.html">Django web application framework</a> includes
<a href="/django-orm.html">the Django ORM</a> layer that allows a deveoper to write
<a href="/databases.html">relational database</a>
read, write, query, and delete operations in Python code rather than SQL. 
However, Django's ORM cannot work without significant modification on 
<a href="/no-sql-datastore.html">non-relational (NoSQL) databases</a> such as 
<a href="/mongodb.html">MongoDB</a> or <a href="/apache-cassandra.html">Cassandra</a>.</p>
<p>Some other web frameworks such as <a href="/flask.html">Flask</a> and 
<a href="/pyramid.html">Pyramid</a> are easier to
use with non-relational databases by incorporating external Python libraries.
There is a spectrum between minimal functionality with easy extensibility on
one end and including everything in the framework with tight integration on
the other end.</p>
<h3>Do I have to use a web framework?</h3>
<p>Whether or not you use a web framework in your project depends on your 
experience with web development and what you're trying to accomplish. If you 
are a beginner programmer and just want to work on a web application as a 
learning project then a framework can help you understand the concepts listed
above, such as URL routing, data manipulation and authentication that are
common to the majority of web applications.</p>
<p>On the other hand if you're an experienced programmer with significant 
web development experience you may feel like the existing frameworks do not
match your project's requirements. In that case, you can mix and match
open source libraries such as <a href="http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/">Werkzeug</a> for
WSGI plumbing with your own code to create your own framework. There's 
still plenty of room in the Python ecosystem for new frameworks to satisfy 
the needs of web developers that are unmet by <a href="/django.html">Django</a>, 
<a href="/flask.html">Flask</a>, <a href="/pyramid.html">Pyramid</a>, <a href="/bottle.html">Bottle</a> and 
<a href="/other-web-frameworks.html">many others</a>.</p>
<p>In short, whether or not you need to use a web framework to build a web 
application depends on your experience and what you're trying to accomplish. 
Using a web framework to build a web application certainly isn't required, 
but it'll make most developers' lives easier in many cases.</p>
<h3>Comparing web frameworks</h3>
<p>Are you curious about how the code in a Django project is structured compared 
with Flask? Check out

<h3>Web framework resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you are learning how to use one or more web frameworks it's helpful
  to have an idea of what the code under the covers is doing. This post on

  is a simplification of what frameworks such as <a href="/django.html">Django</a>, 
  <a href="/flask.html">Flask</a> and <a href="/pyramid.html">Pyramid</a> allow developers to 
  accomplish.</p>

<h3>Web frameworks learning checklist</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Choose a major Python web framework (<a href="/django.html">Django</a> or 
   <a href="/flask.html">Flask</a> are recommended) and stick with it. When you're just
   starting it's best to learn one framework first instead of bouncing around
   trying to understand every framework. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work through a detailed tutorial found within the resources links on the
   framework's page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study open source examples built with your framework of choice so you can 
   take parts of those projects and reuse the code in your application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build the first simple iteration of your web application then go to
   the <a href="/deployment.html">deployment</a> section to make it accessible on the 
   web.</p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>Django</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> is a widely-used Python web 
application framework with a "batteries-included" philosophy. The principle
behind batteries-included is that the common functionality for building
web applications should come with the framework instead of as separate
libraries.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/logos/django.png" width="100%" alt="Official Django logo. Trademark Django Software Foundation." class="shot"></a></p>
<p>For example, 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/auth/">authentication</a>,
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/urls/">URL routing</a>, a 
<a href="/django-templates.html">template engine</a>,
an <a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">object-relational mapper</a> (ORM),
and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/">database schema migrations</a>
(as of version 1.7) are all included with the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Django/">Django framework</a>. 
Compare that included functionality to the Flask framework which requires a 
separate library such as 
<a href="https://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Flask-Login</a>
to perform user authentication. </p>
<p>The batteries-included and extensibility philosophies are simply two different
ways to tackle framework building. Neither philosophy is inherently better 
than the other one.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Django is an implementation of the <a href="/web-frameworks.html">web frameworks</a> concept.

<h2>Why is Django a good web framework choice?</h2>
<p>The Django project's stability, performance and community have grown 
tremendously over the past decade since the framework's creation. Detailed
tutorials and good practices are readily available on the web and in books.
The framework continues to add significant new functionality such as 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/migrations/">database migrations</a>
with each release. </p>
<p>I highly recommend the Django framework as a starting place for new Python web 
developers because the official documentation and tutorials are some of the 
best anywhere in software development. Many cities also have Django-specific
groups such as <a href="http://www.meetup.com/django-district/">Django District</a>,
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/">Django Boston</a> and 
<a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-San-Francisco-Django-Meetup-Group/">San Francisco Django</a> 
so new developers can get help when they are stuck.</p>
<p>There's some debate on whether 
<a href="http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/12/11/learning-python-via-django-considered-harmful/">learning Python by using Django is a bad idea</a>. 
However, that criticism is invalid if you take the time to learn the Python
syntax and language semantics first before diving into web development.</p>
<h2>Django books and tutorials</h2>
<p>There are a slew of free or low cost resources out there for Django. Make
sure to check the version numbers used in each post you read because 
Django was released over 10 years ago and has had a huge number of updates
since then. These resources are geared towards beginners. If you are already
experienced with Django you should take a look at the next section of
resources for more advanced tutorials.</p>
<ul>

  the development of a website using the Django web framework as a real
  world example of how to perform test-driven development (TDD). There is
  also coverage of NoSQL, WebSockets and asynchronous responses. The book can
  be read online for free or purchased in hard copy via O'Reilly.</p>

   <h1>Flask</h1>
<p><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> (<a href="https://github.com/pallets/flask">source code</a>)
is a Python <a href="/web-frameworks.html">web framework</a> built with a 
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/design/">small core and easy-to-extend philosophy</a>. </p>
<p><a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/logos/flask.jpg" width="100%" alt="Official Flask logo. Flask Artwork License." class="technical-diagram"></a></p>
<h3>Why is Flask a good web framework choice?</h3>
<p>Flask is considered more 
<a href="http://blog.startifact.com/posts/older/what-is-pythonic.html">Pythonic</a>
than the <a href="/django.html">Django</a> web framework because in common situations the
equivalent Flask web application is more explicit. Flask is also easy to get 
started with as a beginner because there is little boilerplate code for getting a 
simple app up and running. </p>
<p>For example, here is a valid "Hello, world!" web application with Flask:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">flask</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Flask</span>
<span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Flask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="vm">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>


<span class="nd">@app.route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello_world</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Hello, World!&#39;</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s1">&#39;__main__&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The above code shows "Hello, World!" on localhost port 5000 in a web browser 
when run with the <code>python app.py</code> command and the Flask library installed.</p>
<p>The equivalent "Hello, World!" web application using the <a href="/django.html">Django</a>
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">web framework</a> would involve significantly more boilerplate
code.</p>
<p>Flask was also written several years after Django and therefore
learned from the Python community's reactions as the framework evolved.
Jökull Sólberg wrote a great piece articulating to this effect in his 
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160305145017/http://jokull.calepin.co/my-flask-to-django-experience.html">experience switching between Flask and Django</a>.</p>

<h3>How does Flask relate to the Pallets Projects?</h3>
<p>Flask was originally designed and developed by Armin Ronacher as an 
<a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2010/4/3/april-1st-post-mortem/">April Fool's Day joke in 2010</a>.
Despite the origin as a joke, the Flask framework became wildly popular as 
an alternative to Django projects with their monolithic structure and 
dependencies.</p>
<p>Flask's success created a lot of additional work in issue tickets and pull 
requests. Armin eventually created 
<a href="https://www.palletsprojects.com/">The Pallets Projects</a> collection of open
source code libraries after he had been managing Flask under his own GitHub 
account for several years. The Pallets Project now serves as the 
community-driven organization that handles Flask and other related Python
libraries such as <a href="/lektor.html">Lektor</a>, <a href="/jinja2.html">Jinja</a> and
several others.</p>
<h3>Flask tutorials</h3>
<p>The "Hello, World!" code for Flask is just seven lines of code but learning how
to build full-featured web applications with any framework takes a lot of work.
These resources listed below are the best up-to-date tutorials and references
for getting started.</p>

<h3>Open source Flask example projects</h3>
<p>Flask's lack of standard boilerplate via a commandline interface for
setting up your project structure is a double edged sword. When you
get started with Flask you will have to figure out how to scale the 
files and modules for the code in your application. The following open 
source projects range from simple to complex and can give you ideas 
about how to working on your codebase.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/skylines-project/skylines">Skylines</a> is an open source 
  flight tracking web application built with Flask. You can check out a

<h3>Flask project templates</h3>
<p>Flask's wide array of extension libraries comes at the cost of having a more
complicated project setup. The following project templates provide a starter
base that you can either use for your own applications or just learn various
ways to structure your code.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the 
  <a href="https://github.com/kamalgill/flask-appengine-template">Flask App Engine Template</a>
  for getting set up on Google App Engine with Flask.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/JackStouffer/Flask-Foundation">Flask Foundation</a> is a

   <h1>Bottle</h1>
<p><a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html">Bottle</a> 
(<a href="https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle">source code</a>) is a 
<a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI-compliant</a>
<a href="https://github.com/defnull/bottle/blob/master/bottle.py">single source file</a>
web framework with no external dependencies other than the Python
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/">standard library (stdlib)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/logos/bottle.png" width="100%" alt="Official Bottle logo." class="technical-diagram"></a></p>
<h2>Should I use Bottle for web development?</h2>
<p>Bottle is awesome for a few web development situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prototyping ideas </li>
<li>Learning how web frameworks are built</li>
<li>Building and running simple personal web applications </li>
</ol>
<h4>Prototyping</h4>
<p>Prototyping simple ideas is often easier with Bottle than a more
opinionated web framework like <a href="/django.html">Django</a> because Django
projects start with a significant amount of boilerplate code. The
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/faq/general/#django-appears-to-be-a-mvc-framework-but-you-call-the-controller-the-view-and-the-view-the-template-how-come-you-don-t-use-the-standard-names">Model-View-Template</a>
structure for Django apps within projects makes maintaining projects
easier, but it can be cumbersome on starter projects where you're
just playing with random ideas so you aren't worried about your 
application's long-term code structure.</p>
<h4>Learning about frameworks</h4>
<p>Bottle is contained 
<a href="https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/blob/master/bottle.py">within a single large source file</a> 
named <code>bottle.py</code> so it provides great reading when learning how 
<a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI</a> web frameworks work. Everything you need to learn 
about how your web application's code connects with the Bottle framework is 
contained within that single source code.</p>
<h4>Personal projects</h4>
<p>Personal projects can be deployed with Bottle as the only dependency.
If you've never performed a <a href="/deployment.html">Python web app deployment</a>
before, the number of concepts and steps can be daunting. By packaging
<code>bottle.py</code> with your app's source code, you can skip some of the
steps to more easily get your web application up and running. </p>

   <h1>TurboGears</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.turbogears.org">TurboGears</a>, born as a full stack layer on top
of Pylons, is now a standalone <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI</a> web framework
that can act both as a full  stack framework (like <a href="/django.html">Django</a>) 
or as a micro framework (like <a href="/flask.html">Flask</a>) </p>
<p><a href="http://www.turbogears.org/" style="border: none;">
    <img src="/img/logos/turbogears.jpg" width="100%" alt="TurboGears logo." class="technical-diagram" style="border-radius: 5px;">
</a></p>
<p>Originally inspired by RubyOnRails it's based on MVC
where the controller dispatches the request to a set of actions
exposed from the controller itself.</p>
<p>TurboGears, in its full stack mode, provides all the features
you would require during development of a web application:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://turbogears.readthedocs.io/en/latest/turbogears/authentication.html">Identification and Authentication</a></li>
<li><a href="http://turbogears.readthedocs.io/en/latest/turbogears/authorization.html">Authorization</a></li>
<li><a href="http://turbogears.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/admin.html">Autogenerated Admin and CRUD</a></li>

<li>Request Bound Transactions</li>
<li>Interactive Debugger</li>
<li>Builtin Profiling</li>
<li>Pluggable Applications</li>
</ul>
<p>It's also one of the few web frameworks officially supporting
MongoDB as one of the primary storage backends, including
support into the TurboGears Admin to autogenerate CRUDs
from MongoDB models.</p>
<p>While TurboGears has always been a full stack framework
with same scope of projects like Django, it differentiates
from other frameworks due the its philosophy on two major
parts of a web framework: <em>Templating</em> and <em>Routing</em></p>
<h2>Templating</h2>
<p>While TurboGears provides support for multiple template
engines, the primary one has always been a fully
validated XML template engine. </p>
<p>Currently TurboGears ships with the <code>Kajiki</code> template engine,
which was developed within the project itself, but in the past
it relied on the Genshi and Kid template engines which were
mostly syntax compatible with Kajiki.</p>
<p>Historically validated xml template engines has always been
slower than text template engines, but the Kajiki project
was able to create a very fast template engine that usually
renders faster than Mako or Django Template while
still retaining all the expected features.</p>
<p>The fact that it relies on a validated XML engine provides
some benefits compared to plain text engines like Django
Template, Jinja2 and Mako:</p>
<h3>Automatic Escaping</h3>
<p>It automatically escapes content rendered into the
template, thus making easier to avoid XSS and injection
security issues:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;div&gt;</span><span class="cp">${</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="cp">}</span><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>with <code>value='&lt;script&gt;alert("hello")&lt;/script&gt;'</code>
will render as</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">&lt;div&gt;</span><span class="ni">&amp;lt;</span>script<span class="ni">&amp;gt;</span>alert(<span class="ni">&amp;quot;</span>hello<span class="ni">&amp;quot;</span>)<span class="ni">&amp;lt;</span>/script<span class="ni">&amp;gt;</span><span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>;
</pre></div>


<p>thus preventing any form of injection from user provided content.</p>
<h3>Automatic Internationalization</h3>
<p>The template engine parses the provided template document
and recognises the nodes that contain static text.</p>
<p>As the engine is able to distinguish text from markup it's
able to flag the text for translation.</p>
<p>Content like <code>&lt;div&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;</code> would get automatically
translated if a translation for <code>"Hello World"</code> is provided, 
without having to wrap text in <code>gettext</code> calls.</p>
<h3>Compatibility with WYSIWYG Editors</h3>
<p>As the template engine syntax is purely valid XHTML
the template itself can be opened with WYSIWYG editors
and as far as they don't strip unknown attributes
the template can be edited and saved back from those editors.</p>
<h2>Routing</h2>
<p>Most web frameworks have been relying on regular expressions
to declare routing, through decorators or through a routing map.</p>
<p>TurboGears supports regular expressions through the <code>tgext.routes</code>
extension, but the preferred way of routing is through the
<code>Object Dispatch</code> system.</p>
<p>In Object Dispatch a root controller object is traversed while
resolving the URL. Each part of the url path is mapped to a property
of the controller (Which might point to a sub controller) until
a final callable action is encountered.</p>
<p>This leads to a very natural mapping between URLs and the code
serving them, allowing people with minimal knowledge of a project
to jump in and quickly find actions in charge of serving a specific page.</p>
<p>In Object Dispatch an URL like <code>/users/new?name=MyName</code> 
would be served by a hierarchy of objects like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kr">class</span> <span class="nx">UsersController</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">TGController</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="kd">@expose</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="nx">def</span> <span class="k">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nx">None</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span>
       <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Hi, %s&#39;</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="nx">name</span>

<span class="kr">class</span> <span class="nx">RootController</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">TGController</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="nx">users</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">UsersController</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>It's easy to see how <code>/users/new</code> actually resolves
to <code>RootController.users.new</code> and all options provided
to the URL are passed to the action serving the response
as arguments.</p>

   <h1>Morepath</h1>
<p><a href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Morepath</a> is a micro web 
framework with a model-driven approach to creating web applications and web
APIs.</p>
<p>Morepath's framework philosophy is that the data models should drive the
creation via the web framework. By default the framework routes URLs directly 
to model code, unlike for example Django which requires explicit URL routing
by the developer.</p>
<h2>Why is Morepath an interesting web framework?</h2>
<p>Simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD web applications and APIs</a> 
can be tedious to build when they are driven straight from data models without
much logic between the model and the view. Learn more about how Morepath
<a href="http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/compared.html">compares with other web frameworks</a>
from the creator.</p>
<p>With the rise of front end JavaScript frameworks, many Python web frameworks 
are first being used to build 
<a href="/application-programming-interfaces.html">RESTful APIs</a> that return JSON
instead rendering HTML via a templating system. Morepath appears to have 
been created with the RESTful API model approach in mind and cuts out the 
assumption that templates will drive the user interface.</p>

   <h1>Sanic</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/channelcat/sanic">Sanic</a> is a 
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">Python web framework</a> built on 
<a href="https://magic.io/blog/uvloop-blazing-fast-python-networking/">uvloop</a> and 
designed for fast HTTP responses via asynchronous request handling. </p>

<h2>What are the tradeoffs of using Sanic?</h2>
<p>Sanic cannot be developed or deployed on Windows due to its 
necessary <a href="https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop">uvloop</a> dependency.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Sanic is an implementation of the <a href="/web-frameworks.html">web framework</a> concept. Learn how these parts fit together in the <a href="/web-development.html">web development</a> chapter or view <a href="/table-of-contents.html">all topics</a>.</div>

<p>There was 
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/5ryiq7/sticking_with_flask_vs_switching_to_one_of_the/">an excellent discussion on the /r/python subreddit</a> 
about using one of the newer async frameworks such as Sanic or Japronto 
compared with a traditional <a href="/web-frameworks.html">web framework</a> like 
<a href="/django.html">Django</a>. One of the major tradeoff of adopting a newer
framework is simply that the code library ecosystem has not, and may never,
grow up around that framework. You have to accept the risk that you will
need to build a significant amount of the plumbing yourself rather than
<code>pip</code> installing existing, well-tested libraries.</p>
<h3>Sanic tutorials</h3>
<p>Sanic is under very active development and is still in its infancy as a
web framework. The following tutorials will get you started but there is
a chance you will have to work through errors as Sanic is regularly updated.</p>

<h2>Other frameworks learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Read through the web frameworks listed above and check out their project
   websites. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's useful to know what other web frameworks exist besides Django and 
   Flask. However, when you're just starting to learn to program there are 
   significantly more tutorials and resources for <a href="/django.html">Django</a> and 
   <a href="/flask.html">Flask</a> on the web. My recommendation is to start with one of
   those two frameworks then expand your knowledge from there.</p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>Template Engines</h1>
<p>Template engines take in tokenized strings and produce rendered strings with
values in place of the tokens as output. Templates are typically used as
an intermediate format written by developers to programmatically 
produce one or more desired output formats, commonly HTML, XML or PDF.</p>
<h2>Why are template engines important?</h2>
<p>Template engines allow developers to generate desired content types, such 
as HTML, while using some of the data and programming constructs such as 
conditionals and for loops to manipulate the output. Template files that are 
created by developers and then processed by the template engine consist of
prewritten markup and template tag blocks where data is inserted.</p>
<p>For example, look at the first ten source lines of HTML of this webpage:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">html</span> <span class="na">lang</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;en&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>

<p>Every one of the HTML lines above is standard for each page on Full Stack 
Python, with the exception of the <code>&lt;meta name="description"...</code> line which 
provides a unique short description of what the individual page contains.</p>
<p>The 
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/blob/master/theme/templates/base.html">base.html Jinja template</a>
used to generate Full Stack Python allows every page on the site to have 
consistent HTML but dynamically generate the pieces that need to change 
between pages when the <a href="/static-site-generator.html">static site generator</a>

<p>In a typical <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI application</a>, the template engine 
would generate the HTML output response when an HTTP request comes in for a 
particular URL. </p>
<h2>Python template engines</h2>
<p>There are several popular Python template engines. A template engine 
implementation will fall somewhere on the spectrum between allowing 
arbitrary code execution and granting only a limited set of capabilities 
via template tags. A rough visual of the code in template spectrum can be 
seen below for four of the major Python template engines.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/template-logic-spectrum.png" width="100%" alt="Spectrum between no logic in templates and the ability to run arbitrary code." class="technical-diagram" style="border-radius: 5px;"></p>
<h3>Jinja (Jinja2)</h3>
<p><a href="/jinja2.html">Jinja</a>, also known and referred to as "Jinja2", is a popular 
Python template engine written as a self-contained open source project. Some
template engines, such as <a href="/django-templates.html">Django templates</a> are 
provided as part of a larger <a href="/web-frameworks.html">web framework</a>, which
can make them difficult to reuse in projects outside their coupled library.</p>
<p>Major Python open source applications such as the 
<a href="/configuration-management.html">configuration management</a> tools Ansible
and <a href="https://github.com/saltstack/salt">SaltStack</a>
as well as the <a href="/static-site-generator.html">static site generator</a> Pelican 
use the Jinja template engine by default for generating output files.</p>
<p>There is a whole lot more to learn about Jinja on the 
<a href="/jinja2.html">Jinja2 page</a>.</p>
<h3>Django templating</h3>
<p>Django comes with its 
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/">own template engine</a>
in addition to supporting (as of Django 1.9) drop-in replacement with other
template engines such as Jinja.</p>
<h3>Mako template engine</h3>
<p><a href="/mako.html">Mako</a> was the default templating engine for the 
Pylons web framework and is one of many template engines supported by 
<a href="/pyramid.html">Pyramid</a>. Mako has wide support as a replacement
template engine for many <a href="/other-web-frameworks.html">other web frameworks</a>
as well.</p>
<h3>Other Python template engine implementations</h3>
<p>There are numerous Python template engine implementations that range from
weekend hacks to actively developed mature libraries. These template
engines are listed alphabetically:</p>

<h3>Template engine resources</h3>
<p>Template engines are often used with web frameworks a black box where input 
goes in, and rendered text magically appears out the other side. However,
when something unexpected returns from a template engine it is useful to
know how they work to aid your debugging. The following resources examine
existing template engine design as well as how to build your own engine
when that's necessary for your projects.</p>

   <h1>Jinja2</h1>
<p>Jinja, also commonly referred to as 
"<a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/">Jinja2</a>" to specify the newest 
release version, is a Python <a href="/template-engines.html">template engine</a> 
used to create HTML, XML or other markup formats that are returned to the 
user via an HTTP response.</p>
<p><a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/"  style="border: none;"><img src="/img/logos/jinja.png" width="100%" alt="Logo for the Jinja template engine project." style="border-radius: 5px;" width="100%" class="technical-diagram"></a></p>
<h2>Why is Jinja2 useful?</h2>
<p>Jinja2 is useful because it has consistent template tag syntax and the
project is cleanly extracted as 
<a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2">an independent open source project</a> so
it can be used as a dependency by other code libraries.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Jinja2 is an implementation of the <a href="/template-engines.html">template engines</a> concept. Learn more in the <a href="/web-development.html">web development</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<p>Jinja2 strikes a thoughtful balance on the template engine spectrum where
on one end you can embed arbitrary code in the templates and the other
end a developer can code whatever she wants.</p>
<h2>Jinja2 origin and development</h2>
<p>The first recorded public released of Jinja2 was in 
<a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/changelog/#version-2-0rc1">2008 with 2.0rc1</a>.
Since then the engine has seen numerous updates and remains in active
development.</p>
<p>Jinja2 engine certainly wasn't the first template engine. In fact, Jinja2's 
syntax is inspired by Django's built-in template engine, which was released 
several years earlier. There were many template systems, such as 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages">JavaServer Pages (JSPs)</a>,
that originated almost a decade before Jinja2. Jinja2 built upon the concepts
of other template engines and today is widely used by the Python community.</p>
<h2>What projects depend on Jinja2?</h2>
<p>Jinja2 is a commonly-used templating engine for
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">web frameworks</a> such as <a href="/flask.html">Flask</a>, 
<a href="/bottle.html">Bottle</a>, <a href="/morepath.html">Morepath</a> and, as of its 1.8 update,
optionally <a href="/django.html">Django</a> as well. Jinja2 is also used as a template
language by <a href="/configuration-management.html">configuration management</a> tool 
Ansible and the <a href="/static-site-generator.html">static site generator</a> Pelican,
among many other similar tools.</p>
<p>The idea is that if a developer already knows Jinja2 from working with one 
project then the exact same syntax and style can be used in another project 
that requires templating. The re-use reduces the learning curve and saves the
open source project author from having to reinvent a new templating style.</p>
<h3>Jinja2 resources</h3>

   provides some basic benchmarks comparing Mako, Jinja and other template
   engines. Any benchmark should be taken as a data point rather than a 
   rule on which engine is actually the fastest in real world scenarios.
   In addition, if you are using Mako or any other template engine as part
   of a static website generator then it will not really matter which one
   is the fastest because the output is created before the website is 
   deployed rather than during the <a href="/web-servers.html">web server</a>'s

<h2>What's the difference between a "project template" and Django templates?</h2>
<p>A project template contains the files and code to start a new web application.
For example, when you run <code>django-admin.py startproject abc</code>, the Django
admin script creates a new <code>abc</code> directory along with several Python 
configuration so the web app can be run by a <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI server</a>.</p>
<p>Django templates are different from a project template because they live 
within a project and are written by the developer to generate output, most
commonly HTML.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Django templates are an implementation of the <a href="/template-engines.html">template engines</a> concept.

   <h1>Web Design</h1>
<p>Web design is the creation of a web application's style and user interaction
using CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Why is web design important?</h2>
<p>You wouldn’t use a web application that looked like the following screenshot, 
would you?</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/no-style-webpage.png" width="100%" alt="HTML with no CSS or JavaScript." class="shot rnd outl"> </p>
<p>Creating web pages with their own style and interactivity so users can easily
accomplish their tasks is a major part of building modern web applications.</p>
<h2>Designing for various screen sizes</h2>
<p>Separating the content from the rules for how to display the content allows 
devices to render the output differently based on factors such as screen size
and device type. Displaying content differently based on varying screen 
attributes is often called <em>responsive design</em>. The responsiveness is 
accomplished by implementing
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Media_queries">media queries</a>
in the <a href="/cascading-style-sheets.html">CSS</a>. </p>
<p>For example, a mobile device does not have as much space to display a 
navigation bar on the side of a page so it is often pushed down 
below the main content. The 
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/examples/blog/">Bootstrap Blog example</a> 
shows that navigation bar relocation scenario when you resize the browser 
width.</p>
<h2>Fantastic design resources</h2>

(hopefully much) better with design.</p>

   <h1>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h1>
<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language that is 
downloaded from a <a href="/web-servers.html">web server</a> to a web browser
and is used to display website and web application content.</p>
<p><img src="/img/logos/html.jpg" alt="HTML5 logo." width="100%" class="technical-diagram"></p>

   <h1>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h1>
<p>Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) files contain rules for how to display and 
lay out the HTML content when it is rendered by a web browser.</p>
<p><img src="/img/logos/css.jpg" width="100%" alt="CSS3 logo." class="shot"></p>
<h2>Why is CSS necessary?</h2>
<p>CSS separates the content contained in HTML files from how the content 
should be displayed. It is important to separate the content from the rules
for how it should be rendered primarily because it is easier to reuse those
rules across many pages. CSS files are also much easier to maintain on large
projects than styles embedded within the HTML files.</p>
<h2>How is CSS retrieved from a web server?</h2>
<p>The HTML file sent by the web server contains a reference to the CSS file(s)
needed to render the content. The web browser requests the CSS file after the
HTML file as shown below in a screenshot captured of the Chrome Web Developer 
Tools network traffic.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/css-chrome-dev-tools.jpg" width="100%" alt="Google Chrome Web Developer Tools shows how CSS is separate from the HTML content." class="shot rnd outl"></p>
<p>That request for the fsp.css file is made because the HTML file for Full 
Stack Python contains a reference to <code>theme/css/fsp.css</code> which is shown
in the view source screenshot below.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/fsp-css-source.jpg" width="100%" alt="View source screenshot for the fsp.css file in index.html." class="shot rnd outl" /></p>
<h2>CSS preprocessors</h2>
<p>A CSS preprocessor compiles a processed language into plain CSS code. CSS 
preprocessing languages add syntax such as variables, mixins and functions
to reduce code duplication. The additional syntax also makes it possible for
designers to use these basic programming constructs to write maintainable
front end code.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> is currently the favored preprocessor in
  the design community. Sass is considered the most powerful CSS preprocessor
  in terms of advanced language features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> is right up there with Sass and has an ace up
  its sleeve in that the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap Framework</a> is
  written in LESS which brings up its popularity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/">Stylus</a> is often cited as the third
  most popular CSS preprocessing language.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>CSS learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a simple HTML file with basic elements in it. Use the
   <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> command to serve it up. Create a 
   <code>&lt;style&gt;&lt;/style&gt;</code> element within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section in the HTML
   markup. Play with CSS within that style element to change the look and 
   feel of the page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check out front end frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation and integrate
   one of those into the HTML page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work through the framework's grid system, styling options and customization
   so you get comfortable with how to use the framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply the framework to your web application and tweak the design until you
   have something that looks much better than generic HTML.</p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>Responsive design</h1>

   <h1>Minification</h1>
<p>Minification is the process of reducing the size of 
<a href="/static-content.html">static content assets</a> that need to be transferred 
from a <a href="/web-servers.html">web server</a> to the web browser client. The goal
of minification is to make webpages and web applications load faster, 
<em>without changing how the assets are ultimately used after being downloaded</em>.</p>
<p><a href="/cascading-style-sheets.html">Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) files</a>, 
<a href="/javascript.html">JavaScript</a> and even HTML can be minified. The techniques 
to minify an HTML file differ from a CSS file because the file's contents
and syntax are different.</p>
<h2>CSS Minification example</h2>
<p>Let's say your web application has a CSS file with the following four lines
to add some padding around every element with the <code>pad-me</code> class:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="na">.pad-me</span> <span class="err">{</span> <span class="no">padding-top</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="no">px</span><span class="c">;</span>
          <span class="nl">padding-right:</span> <span class="err">5</span><span class="nf">px</span><span class="c">;</span>
          <span class="nl">padding-left:</span> <span class="err">5</span><span class="nf">px</span><span class="c">;</span>
          <span class="nl">padding-bottom:</span> <span class="err">10</span><span class="nf">px</span><span class="c">; }</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That example has 122 characters. A CSS minifier would take the above four 
lines and convert them to the following single line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="na">.pad-me</span><span class="err">{</span><span class="no">padding</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="no">px</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="no">px</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="no">px</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="no">px</span><span class="err">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The result would have only a single line with 35 characters, that's 87 less 
characters that would need to be sent from the web server to the web browser!
The minification process reduced the single CSS class by 71% but kept the exact
same result when the web browser applies <code>pad-me</code> to all elements with that
class.</p>
<p>The file size savings can be a major benefit when applied across hundreds or
thousands of lines in a typical CSS file. When you also multiply that savings 
across every client that downloads the CSS from your web server or CDN it becomes
clear that minification is a powerful way to improve the efficiency of your 
production web application.</p>

<h2>Should I use Bootstrap 3 or 4?</h2>
<p><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/">Bootstrap 3</a> was out for almost five
years before 
<a href="http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2018/01/18/bootstrap-4/">Bootstrap 4</a> was
finally released at the start of 2018. When learning Bootstrap you will
likely come across many tutorials that cover Bootstrap 3 but not version 4.</p>
<p>If you are completely new to Bootstrap and CSS frameworks in general then
I recommend learning Bootstrap 4. If you have already been working with
Bootstrap 3 then there is no major rush to upgrade to the latest version.
Bootstrap 4 is more complicated than version 3 because it has a lot more
features so the learning curve is a bit steeper.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fullstackpython.com/">Full Stack Python</a> is actually built
with an early version of Bootstrap 3. However, this site is so heavily
customized with my own CSS that I likely will never upgrade to Bootstrap 4
because there are no new features that I feel will be useful in my
specific situation.</p>

   <h1>JavaScript</h1>
<p>JavaScript is a scripting programming language interpretted by web 
browsers that enables dynamic content and interactions in web applications. </p>
<h2>Why is JavaScript necessary?</h2>
<p>JavaScript executes in the client and enables dynamic content and interaction
that is not possible with HTML and CSS alone. Every modern Python web 
application uses JavaScript on the front end. </p>
<h2>Front end frameworks</h2>
<p>Front end JavaScript frameworks move the rendering for most of a web 
application to the client side. Often these applications are informally 
referred to as "one page apps" because the webpage is not reloaded upon every
click to a new URL. Instead, partial HTML pages are loaded into the 
document object model or data is retrieved through an API call then displayed
on the existing page.</p>
<p>Examples of these front end frameworks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Front end frameworks are rapidly evolving. Over the next several years 
consensus about good practices for using the frameworks will emerge.</p>
<h2>How did JavaScript originate?</h2>
<p>JavaScript is an implementation of 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/JavaScript_Overview">the ECMAScript specification</a> 
which is defined by the 
<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/default.htm">Ecma International Standards Body</a>.</p>

<h3>JavaScript learning checklist</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create a simple HTML file with basic elements in it. Use the
   <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> command to serve it up. Create a 
   <code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> 
   element at the end of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section in the HTML page. Play
   with JavaScript within that element to learn the basic syntax.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a> and add it to the page above your 
   JavaScript element. Start working with JQuery and learning how it makes 
   basic JavaScript easier.</p>

   <h1>Task queues</h1>
<p>Task queues manage background work that must be executed outside the usual
HTTP request-response cycle.</p>
<h2>Why are task queues necessary?</h2>
<p>Tasks are handled asynchronously either because they are not initiated by
an HTTP request or because they are long-running jobs that would dramatically
reduce the performance of an HTTP response.</p>
<p>For example, a web application could poll the GitHub API every 10 minutes to
collect the names of the top 100 starred repositories. A task queue would
handle invoking code to call the GitHub API, process the results and store them
in a persistent database for later use.</p>
<p>Another example is when a database query would take too long during the HTTP
request-response cycle. The query could be performed in the background on a
fixed interval with the results stored in the database. When an
HTTP request comes in that needs those results a query would simply fetch the
precalculated result instead of re-executing the longer query.
This precalculation scenario is a form of <a href="/caching.html">caching</a> enabled
by task queues.</p>
<p>Other types of jobs for task queues include</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>spreading out large numbers of independent database inserts over time
  instead of inserting everything at once</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>aggregating collected data values on a fixed interval, such as every
  15 minutes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>scheduling periodic jobs such as batch processes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Task queue projects</h2>
<p>The defacto standard Python task queue is <a href="/celery.html">Celery</a>. The other
task queue projects that arise tend to come from the perspective that
Celery is overly complicated for simple use cases. My recommendation is to
put the effort into Celery's reasonable learning curve as it is worth the
time it takes to understand how to use the project.</p>

<h3>Task queue learning checklist</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick a slow function in your project that is called during an HTTP
   request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine if you can precompute the results on a fixed interval instead
   of during the HTTP request. If so, create a separate function you can call
   from elsewhere then store the precomputed value in the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read the Celery documentation and the links in the resources section below
   to understand how the project works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install a message broker such as RabbitMQ or Redis and then add Celery to
   your project. Configure Celery to work with the installed message broker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use Celery to invoke the function from step one on a regular basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have the HTTP request function use the precomputed value instead of the
   slow running code it originally relied upon.</p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>Celery</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">Celery</a> is a <a href="/task-queues.html">task queue</a> 
implementation for <a href="/web-development.html">Python web applications</a> used
to asynchronously execute work outside the HTTP request-response cycle.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/" style="border:none"><img src="/img/logos/celery.png" alt="Celery task queue project logo." class="shot" width="100%"></a></p>
<div class="well see-also">Celery is an implementation of the <a href="/task-queues.html">task queue</a> concept. Learn more in the <a href="/web-development.html">web development</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>Why is Celery useful?</h2>
<p><a href="/task-queues.html">Task queues</a> and the Celery implementation in particular 
are one of the trickier parts of a Python web application stack to 
understand. </p>
<p>If you are a junior developer it can be unclear why moving work 
outside the HTTP request-response cycle is important. In short, you want your <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI server</a> to respond to incoming requests as quickly 
as possible because each request ties up a worker process until the response 
is finished. Moving work off those workers by spinning up asynchronous jobs
as tasks in a queue is a straightforward way to improve WSGI server response
times.</p>
<h2>What's the difference between Celeryd and Celerybeat?</h2>
<p>Celery can be used to run batch jobs in the background on a
regular schedule. A key concept in Celery is the difference between the 
Celery daemon (celeryd), which executes tasks, Celerybeat, which is a 
scheduler. Think of Celeryd as a tunnel-vision set of one or more workers 
that handle whatever tasks you put in front of them. Each worker will
perform a task and when the task is completed will pick up the next one.
The cycle will repeat continously, only waiting idly when there are no more
tasks to put in front of them.</p>
<p>Celerybeat on the other hand is like a boss who keeps track of when tasks
should be executed. Your application can tell Celerybeat to execute a task
at time intervals, such as every 5 seconds or once a week. Celerybeat can
also be instructed to run tasks on a specific date or time, such as 5:03pm
every Sunday. When the interval or specific time is hit, Celerybeat will
hand the job over to Celeryd to execute on the next available worker.</p>
<h3>Celery tutorials and advice</h3>
<p>Celery is a powerful tool that can be difficult to wrap your mind around
at first. Be sure to read up on <a href="/task-queues.html">task queue</a> concepts
then dive into these specific Celery tutorials.</p>

  them is the best strategy without any downsides. However, keep in mind that 
  any testing method that is not the same as how the function will execute 
  in a production environment can potentially lead to overlooked bugs. There

   <h1>Static Site Generator</h1>
<p>A static website generator combines a markup language, such as Markdown 
or reStructuredText, with a templating engine such as 
<a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja</a>, to produce HTML 
files. The HTML files can be hosted and served by a 
<a href="/web-servers.html">web server</a> or 
<a href="/static-content.html">content delivery network (CDN)</a> 
<em>without</em> any additional dependencies such as a 
<a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI server</a>.</p>
<h2>Why are static site generators useful?</h2>
<p><a href="/static-content.html">Static content files</a> such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
can be served from a content delivery network (CDN) for high scale and low 
cost. If a statically generated website is hit by high concurrent traffic it 
will be easily served by the CDN without dropped connections. </p>
<p>For example, when 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7985692">Full Stack Python was on the top of Hacker News</a> 
for a weekend, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> was used as a CDN
to serve the site and didn't have any issues even with close to 400 
concurrent connections at a time, as shown in the following Google Analytics 
screenshot captured during that traffic burst.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/hacker-news-traffic.jpg" width="100%" alt="Example of how static websites scale with a CDN based on Full Stack Python on Hacker News front page traffic." class="technical-diagram"></p>
<h2>How do static website generators work?</h2>
<p>Static site generators allow a user to create HTML files by writing in a
markup language and coding template files. The static site generator then
combines the markup language and templates to produce HTML. The output HTML 
does not need to be maintained by hand because it is regenerated every time
the markup or templates are modified.</p>
<p>For example, as shown in the diagram below, the Pelican static site 
generator can take in reStructuredText files and Jinja2 template files 
as input then combine them to output a set of static HTML files.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/pelican-flow.jpg" width="100%" alt="Example of how static site generators work with a markup language and templates." class="technical-diagram"></p>
<h2>What's the downside of using static site generators?</h2>
<p>The major downside is that code cannot be executed after a site is created. 
You are stuck with the output files so if you're used to building web 
applications with a traditional <a href="/web-frameworks.html">web framework</a> you'll
have to change your expectations. </p>
<p>Content that is typically powered by a database, such as comments, sessions 
and user data can only be handled through third party services. For example, 
if you want to have comments on a static website you'd need to 
<a href="https://disqus.com/">embed Disqus's form</a> and be completely reliant upon
their service.</p>
<p>Many web applications simply cannot be built with only a static site 
generator. However, a static website generator can create part of a site 
that will be served up by a web server while other pages are handled by the 
WSGI server. If done right, those web applications have the potential to 
scale better than if every page is rendered by the WSGI server. The 
complexity may or may not be worth it for your specific application.</p>
<h2>Python implementations</h2>
<p>Numerous static website generators exist in many different languages. The
ones listed here are primarily coded in Python.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/pelican.html">Pelican</a>
  is a commonly used Python static website generator which is used to create 
  <a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com">Full Stack Python</a>. The
  primary templating engine is Jinja and Markdown, reStructuredText and
  AsciiDoc are supported with the default configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/lektor.html">Lektor</a> is a static content management system and site
  generator that can deploy its output to any webserver. It uses 
  <a href="/jinja2.html">Jinja2</a> as its <a href="/template-engines.html">template engine</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/mkdocs.html">MkDocs</a> uses a YAML configuration
  file to take Markdown files and an optional theme to output a documentation
  site. The templating engine is Jinja, but a user doesn't have to create her
  own templates unless a custom site is desired at which point it might make
  more sense to use a different static site generator instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://mynt.uhnomoli.com/">mynt</a> 
  (<a href="https://github.com/Anomareh/mynt">source code</a>) is built to create
  blogs and uses <a href="/jinja2.html">Jinja</a> to generate HTML pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> 
  (<a href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola">source code</a>) takes in 
  reStructuredText, Markdown or Jupyter (IPython) Notebooks and combines 
  the files with Mako or Jinja2 templates to output static sites. It is 
  compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.3+. Python 2.7 will be dropped 
  in early 2016 while Python 3.3+ will continue to be supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://posativ.org/acrylamid/">Acrylamid</a> 
  (<a href="https://github.com/posativ/acrylamid">source code</a>) uses incremental 
  builds to generate static sites faster than recreating every page after
  each change is made to the input files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://hyde.github.io/">Hyde</a> 
  (<a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde">source code</a>) started out as a Python 
  rewrite of the popular Ruby-based 
  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll static site generator</a>. Today the project
  has moved past those "clone Jekyll" origins. Hyde supports Jinja as well
  as other templating languages and places more emphasis on metadata within
  the markup files to instruct the generator how to produce the output files.
  Check out the 
  <a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde/wiki/Hyde-Powered">Hyde-powered websites</a>
  page to see live examples created with Hyde.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://growsdk.org/">Grow SDK</a> (<a href="http://growsdk.org/">source code</a>) 
  uses projects, known as pods, which contain a specific file and directory 
  structure so the site can be generated. The project remains in the
  "experimental" phase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://complexity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Complexity</a>
  (<a href="https://github.com/audreyr/complexity">source code</a>) is a site generator
  for users who like to work in HTML. It uses HTML for templating but
  has some functionality from Jinja for inheritance. Works with 
  Python 2.6+, 3.3+ and PyPy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cactus (<a href="https://github.com/koenbok/Cactus/">source code</a>) uses the Django
  templating engine that was originally built with front-end designers in
  mind. It works with both Python 2.x and 3.x.</p>

<p>Static site generators can be implemented in any programming language. The
following resources either are general to any programming ecosystem or
provide a unique angle on how to use a static site generator.</p>
<ul>

<p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2016/06/03/ssg-overview-gitlab-pages-part-1-dynamic-x-static/">Static vs Dynamic Websites</a>
  does an excellent job of showing the differences between a dynamic website
  that uses a database backend to produce content in response to a request
  compared with static sites that are pregenerated. There is also a 
  <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2016/06/10/ssg-overview-gitlab-pages-part-2/">second part in the series</a> 
  where generic static site generator concepts are explained.</p>

  on 
  <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/">why static website generators are the next big thing</a>.
  I'd argue static website generators have been big for a long time now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Static site generators can be used for a range of websites from side
  projects up to big sites. This blog post by

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Static site deployment resources</h3>
<p>Deploying a static site is far less complicated than a 
<a href="/deployment.html">traditional web application deployment</a>, but you still
need to host the files somewhere accessible. You'll also to set up DNS to
point a domain name to your site as well as provide HTTPS support.
These guides walk through various ways of handling the static site 
deployment.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Randall Degges' 
  <a href="https://stormpath.com/blog/ultimate-guide-deploying-static-site-aws">Ultimate Guide to Deploying Static Sites to Amazon Web Services</a>

  your site can be loaded via HTTPS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://wsvincent.com/static-site-hosting-with-s3-and-cloudflare/">Static site hosting with S3 and Cloudflare</a>
  shows how to set up an S3 bucket with Cloudflare in front as a CDN that
  serves the content with HTTPS. You should be able to accomplish roughly 
  the same situation with Amazon Cloudfront, but as a Cloudflare user I
  like their service for these static site configurations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google Cloud provides a tutorial on how to use them to 
  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website">host your static site</a>.
  Note that you cannot currently use HTTPS on Google Storage servers, which is a 
  major downside.</p>

   <h1>Pelican</h1>
<p><a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/">Pelican</a> is a 
<a href="/static-site-generator.html">static site generator</a> implemented in Python 
that combines <a href="/jinja2.html">Jinja</a> <a href="/template-engines.html">templates</a> 
with content written in <a href="/markdown.html">Markdown</a> or reStructuredText to 
produce websites. </p>

<h2>Why is Pelican a useful tool?</h2>
<p>Static websites are easier to <a href="/deployment.html">deploy</a> than full web 
applications built with a <a href="/web-frameworks.html">web framework</a> that rely 
on a <a href="/databases.html">persistent database backend</a>. In addition, static
sites are typically much faster to load because there are no database 
queries or middleware code to execute during the HTTP request-response
cycle. </p>
<p>A web server that hosts a static website simply responds to inbound HTTP 
requests with the file being requests - no dynamic data is populated on the
server during the response.</p>
<h3>Pelican resources</h3>
<p>Static site generators like Pelican are a simple compared to 
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">web frameworks</a> so most tutorials focus on
creating simple sites that you can style yourself, as well as deploying

<h2>How is Lektor different from other static site generators?</h2>
<p>Most static site generators such as <a href="/pelican.html">Pelican</a> are built with
programmers as the primary user. Lektor tries to be more accessible to
non-programmers by providing an admin panel for creating and updating
site content similar to Django or Wordpress.</p>

<h2>What's great about MkDocs?</h2>
<p>MkDocs uses a YAML configuration file and can optionally use themes to 
easy change the look-and-feel of the documentation output.</p>
<p>In addition to the easy configuration via a YAML file and the drop-in 
themes, MkDocs also has a wonderful search feature. Search is often not
possible out of the box in other static site generators. With MkDocs search
can easily be added without plugins or code changes to the static site
generator.</p>

   <h1>Testing</h1>
<p>Testing determines whether software runs correctly based on specific inputs 
and identifies defects that need to be fixed.</p>
<h2>Why is testing important?</h2>
<p>As software scales in codebase size, it's impossible for a person or even 
a large team to keep up with all of the changes and
the interactions between the changes. Automated testing is the only proven
method for building reliable software once they grow past the point of a
simple prototype. Many major software program development failures can be
traced back to inadequate or a complete lack of testing.</p>
<p>It's impossible to know whether software works properly unless it is tested.
While testing can be done manually, by a user clicking buttons or typing in 
input, it should be performed automatically by writing software programs that
test the application under test.</p>
<p>There are many forms of testing and they should all be used together. When 
a single function of a program is isolated for testing, that is called
<a href="/unit-testing.html">unit testing</a>. Testing more than a single function 
in an application at the same time is known as 
<a href="/integration-testing.html">integration testing</a>. 
<em>User interface testing</em> ensures the correctness of how a user would 
interact with the software. There are even more forms of testing that large
programs need, such as <em>load testing</em>, <em>database testing</em>, and
<em>browser testing</em> (for web applications).</p>
<h2>Testing in Python</h2>
<p>Python software development culture is heavy on software testing. Because
Python is a dynamically-typed language as opposed to a statically-typed
language, testing takes on even greater importance for ensuring program
correctness.</p>
<h2>Python testing tools</h2>
<p>The Python ecosystem has a wealth of tools to make it easier to run
your tests and interpret the results. The following tools encompass
test runners, coverage reports and related libraries.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cleancut/green">green</a> is a test runner that has
  pretty printing on output to make the results easier to read and
  understand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tryolabs/requestium">requestium</a> merges the
  Requests library with Selenium to make it easier to run automated
  browser tests.</p>

<h3>Mocking resources</h3>
<p>Mocking allows you to isolate parts of your code under test and avoid
areas that are not critical to the tests you are writing. For example,
you may want to test how you handle text message responses but do not
want to actually receive text messages in your application. You can
mock a part of the code that would provide a happy-path scenario so
you can run your tests properly. The following resources show you how to
use mocks in your test cases.</p>
<ul>

   <h1>Unit testing</h1>
<p>Unit testing is a method of determining the correctness of a single function 
isolated from a larger codebase. The idea is that if all the atomic units
of an application work as intended in isolation, then integrating them 
together as intended is much easier.</p>
<h2>Why is unit testing important?</h2>
<p>Unit testing is just one form of <a href="/testing.html">testing</a> that works in
combination with other testing approaches to wring out the bugs from a
piece of software being developed. When several functions and classes are
put together it's often difficult to determine the source of a problem if
several bugs are occurring at the same time. Unit testing helps eliminate
as many of the individual bugs as possible so when the application comes
together as a whole the separate parts work as correct as possible. Then
when issues arise they can often be tracked down as unintended consequences
of the disparate pieces not fitting together properly.</p>
<h2>Unit testing tools</h2>
<p>There are many tools for creating tests in Python. Some of these tools, such
as pytest, replace the built-in unittest framework. Other tools, such as
nose, are extensions that ease test case creation. Note that many of these
tools are also used for <a href="/integration-testing.html">integration testing</a>
by writing the test cases to exercise multiple parts of code at once.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a>
  is the built-in standard library tool for testing Python code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://pytest.org/latest/">pytest</a> is a complete testing tool that
  emphasizes backwards-compatibility and minimizing boilerplate code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">nose</a> is an extension to
  unittest that makes it easier to create and execute test cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Hypothesis</a> is a 
  unit test-generation tool that assists developers in creating tests that
  exercise edge cases in code blocks. The best way to get started using 
  Hypothesis is by going through the well-written
  <a href="http://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html">quickstart</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/lk-geimfari/mimesis">mimesis</a> generates synthetic test 
  data which is useful to apply in your tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Yelp/Testify/">testify</a> was a testing framework
  meant to replace the common unittest+nose combination. However, the team
  behind testify is transitioning to pytest so it's recommended you do
  not use testify for new projects.</p>
</li>
</ul>

  shows how to use the Faker tool with various seeds and outputs into
  your tests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
   <h1>Integration Testing</h1>
<p>Integration testing exercises two or more parts of an application at once, 
including the interactions between the parts, to determine if they function
as intended. This type of <a href="/testing.html">testing</a> identifies defects in 
the interfaces between disparate parts of a codebase as they invoke 
each other and pass data between themselves.</p>
<h2>How is integration testing different from unit testing?</h2>
<p>While <a href="/unit-testing.html">unit testing</a> is used to find bugs in individual
functions, integration testing tests the system as a whole. These two
approaches should be used together, instead of doing just one approach over
the other. When a system is comprehensively unit tested, it makes 
integration testing far easier because many of the bugs in the individual
components will have already been found and fixed. </p>
<p>As a codebase scales up, both unit and integration testing allow 
developers to quickly identify breaking changes in their code. Many times
these breaking changes are unintended and wouldn't be known about until
later in the development cycle, potentially when an end user discovers 
the issue while using the software. Automated unit and integration tests
greatly increase the likelihood that bugs will be found as soon as possible
during development so they can be addressed immediately.</p>
<h3>Integration testing resources</h3>

   <h1>Debugging</h1>
<p>Developers often find themselves in situations where the code they've written
is not working quite right. When that happens, a developer debugs their code
by instrumenting, executing and inspecting the code to determine what state
of the application does not match the assumptions of how the code should
be correctly running.</p>
<h2>Why is debugging important?</h2>
<p>There are bugs in every modest sized or larger application. Every 
developer has to learn how to debug code in order to write programs that
work as correctly as time and budget allow.</p>
<h3>Debugging tools</h3>
<p>There are many debugging tools, some of which are built into 
<a href="/text-editors-ides.html">IDEs</a> like <a href="/pycharm.html">PyCharm</a> and others
that are standalone applications. The following list contains mostly 
standalone tools that you can use in any

   <h1>WebSockets</h1>
<p>A WebSocket is a <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">standard protocol</a> for 
two-way data transfer between a client and server. The WebSockets protocol 
does not run over HTTP, instead it is a separate implementation on top of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>.</p>
<h2>Why use WebSockets?</h2>
<p>A WebSocket connection allows full-duplex communication between a client 
and server so that either side can push data to the other through an 
established connection. The reason why WebSockets, along with the related 
technologies of 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events">Server-sent Events</a> (SSE) 
and 
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-rtcweb-data-channel-12">WebRTC data channels</a>, 
are important is that HTTP is not meant for keeping open a connection for
the server to frequently push data to a web browser. Previously, most web
applications would implement long polling via frequent
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) requests as shown in the below diagram. </p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/ajax-long-polling.png" width="100%" alt="Long polling via AJAX is incredibly inefficient for some applications." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>Server push is more efficient and scalable than long polling because the 
web browser does not have to constantly ask for updates through a stream 
of AJAX requests.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/websockets-flow.png" width="100%" alt="WebSockets are more efficient than long polling for server sent updates." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>While the above diagram shows a server pushing data to the client, WebSockets
is a full-duplex connection so the client can also push data to the server
as shown in the diagram below.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/websockets-flow-with-client-push.png" width="100%" alt="WebSockets also allow client push in addition to server pushed updates." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>The WebSockets approach for server- and client-pushed updates works well for 
certain categories of web applications such as chat room, which is why that's 
often an example application for a WebSocket library.</p>
<h2>Implementing WebSockets</h2>
<p>Both the web browser and the server must implement the WebSockets protocol
to establish and maintain the connection. There are important implications for 
servers since WebSockets connections are long lived, unlike typical HTTP 
connections. </p>
<p>A multi-threaded or multi-process based server cannot scale appropriately for
WebSockets because it is designed to open a connection, handle a request as 
quickly as possible and then close the connection. An asynchronous server such 
as <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/">Tornado</a> or 
<a href="http://gunicorn.org/">Green Unicorn</a> monkey patched with 
<a href="http://www.gevent.org/">gevent</a> is necessary for any practical WebSockets 
server-side implementation.</p>
<p>On the client side, it is not necessary to use a JavaScript library for 
WebSockets. Web browsers that implement WebSockets will expose all necessary
client-side functionality through the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-websockets-20110419/">WebSockets object</a>. </p>
<p>However, a JavaScript wrapper library can make a developer's life easier by 
implementing graceful degradation (often falling back to long-polling when 
WebSockets are not supported) and by providing a wrapper around 
browser-specific WebSocket quirks. Examples of JavaScript client libraries 
and Python implementations are shown in a section below.</p>
<h2>Nginx WebSocket proxying</h2>
<p>Nginx officially supports WebSocket proxying as of 
<a href="http://nginx.com/blog/websocket-nginx/">version 1.3</a>. However, you have
to configure the Upgrade and Connection headers to ensure requests are
passed through Nginx to your WSGI server. It can be tricky to set this up
the first time. </p>
<p>Here are the configuration settings I use in my Nginx file as part of my
WebSockets proxy.</p>

<h2>Python WebSockets implementations</h2>
<p>The following projects either implement WebSockets in Python or provide
example code you can follow to use WebSockets in your own projects.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://crossbar.io/autobahn/">Autobahn</a> uses Twisted and asyncio to
  create the server-side WebSockets component while 
  <a href="https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-js">AutobahnJS</a> assists on the
  client web browser side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Django Channels</a> is built

<h2>JavaScript client libraries</h2>
<p>JavaScript is used to create the client side of the WebSocket connection
because the client is typically a web browser. While you do not need one
of these client-side libraries to use WebSockets, they are useful for 
minimizing the amount of boilerplate code to establish and handle your
connections.</p>

   <h1>Application Programming Interfaces</h1>
<p>Application programming interfaces (APIs) provide machine-readable
data transfer and signaling between applications.</p>
<h2>Why are APIs important?</h2>
<p>HTML, CSS and JavaScript create human-readable webpages. However, those 
webpages are not easily consumable by other machines.</p>
<p>Numerous scraping programs and libraries exist to rip data out of HTML but 
it's simpler to consume data through APIs. For example, if you want the
content of a news article it's easier to get the content through an API than
to scrap the text out of the HTML.</p>
<h2>Key API concepts</h2>
<p>There are several key concepts that get thrown around in the APIs world. It's
best to understand these ideas first before diving into the API literature.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Representation State Transfer (REST)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Webhooks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and Extensible Markup Language (XML)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Endpoints</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Webhooks</h2>
<p>A webhook is a user-defined HTTP callback to a URL that executes when a 
system condition is met. The call alerts the second system via a POST or GET
request and often passes data as well.</p>
<p>Webhooks are important because they enable two-way communication initiation 
for APIs. Webhook flexibility comes in from their definition by the API user
instead of the API itself.</p>
<p>For example, in the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/api">Twilio API</a> when a text 
message is sent to a Twilio phone number Twilio sends an HTTP POST request 
webhook to the URL specified by the user. The URL is defined in a text box
on the number's page on Twilio as shown below.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/twilio-webhook-definition.jpg" width="100%" alt="Webhook definition in the Twilio API." class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<h2>API open source projects</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-core">Swagger</a> is an open source project 
  written in Scala that defines a standard interface for RESTful APIs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>API resources</h2>

<p><a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> has an
  <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/apis-101/">APIs 101</a> free guide for what APIs

<h2>APIs learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Learn the API concepts of machine-to-machine communication with JSON and 
   XML, endpoints and webhooks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate an API such as Twilio or Stripe into your web application. 
   Read the <a href="/api-integration.html">API integration</a> section for more 
   information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a framework to create an API for your own application. Learn about
   web API frameworks on the <a href="/api-creation.html">API creation</a> page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expose your web application's API so other applications can consume data 
   you want to share.</p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>Microservices</h1>
<p>Microservices are an application architecture style where independent,
self-contained programs with a single purpose each can communicate with
each other over a network. Typically, these microservices are able to be
deployed independently because they have strong separation of 
responsibilities via a well-defined specification with significant 
backwards compatibility to avoid sudden dependency breakage.</p>
<h2>Why are microservices getting so much buzz?</h2>
<p>Microservices follow in a long trend of software architecture patterns
that become all the rage. Previously, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Object_Request_Broker_Architecture">CORBA</a> 
and (mostly XML-based) service-oriented architectures (SOA) were the
hip buzzword among ivory tower architects.</p>
<p>However, microservices have more substance because they are typically based
on <a href="/application-programming-interfaces.html">RESTful APIs</a> that are far
easier for actual software developers to use compared with the previous 
complicated XML-based schemas thrown around by enterprise software companies.
In addition, successful applications begin with a monolith-first approach using
a single, shared application codebase and deployment. Only after the application
proves its usefulness is it then broken down into microservice components to
ease further development and deployment. This approach is called the 
"monolith-first" or 
"<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html">MonolithFirst</a>" pattern.</p>
<h3>Microservice resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Martin Fowler's 
  <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html">microservices</a>

<h2>API creation learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick an API framework appropriate for your web framework. For Django I 
   recommend Django REST framework and for Flask I recommend Flask-RESTful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin by building out a simple use case for the API. Generally the use 
   case will either involve data that users want in a machine-readable 
   format or a backend for alternative clients such as an iOS or Android 
   mobile app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add an authentication mechanism through OAuth or a token scheme.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add rate limiting to the API if data usage volume could be a performance 
   issue. Also add basic metrics so you can determine how often the API is 
   being accessed and whether it is performing properly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide ample documentation and a walkthrough for how the API can be 
   accessed and used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figure out other use cases and expand based on what you learned with the 
   initial API use case.</p>
</li>
</ol>

   <h1>API Integration</h1>
<p>The majority of production Python web applications rely on several
externally hosted application programming interfaces (APIs). APIs are also
commonly referred to as third party services or external platforms. 
Examples include <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/">Twilio</a> for messaging and 
voice services, <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api">Stripe</a> for payment processing 
and <a href="https://disqus.com/api/docs/">Disqus</a> for embedded webpage comments.</p>
<p>There are many articles about proper API design but best practices for 
integrating APIs is less commonly written about. However, this subject 
continuously grows in importance because APIs provide critical functionality
across many implementation areas.</p>
<h2>API testing services</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.runscope.com/">Runscope</a> is a service specifically designed
  for APIs that assists developers with automated testing and traffic
  inspection.</p>
</li>

  they are easier to test and generate clean documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>API Integration Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some developers prefer to use 
  <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">Requests</a> instead of an API's 
  helper library. In that case check out this 
  <a href="http://engineering.hackerearth.com/2014/08/21/python-requests-module/">tutorial on using requests to access web APIs</a>.</p>

  <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/e/an-api-for-everything">commercial and free web APIs</a>
  to show "there's an API for everything".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's a list of all government web APIs at 
  <a href="http://18f.github.io/API-All-the-X/">18F's API-All-the-X list</a>. The list
  is updated whenever a new API comes online.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>API integration learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pick an API known for top notch documentation. Here's a list of 
   <a href="https://medium.com/she-hacks-hacker-academy/4d3c43be9386">ten APIs that are a good starting point for beginners</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read the API documentation for your chosen API. Figure out a simple 
   use case for how your application could be improved by using that API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before you start writing any code, play around with the API through the 
   commandline with <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a> or in the browser with 
   <a href="http://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>. This exercise will help you get 
   a better understanding of API authentication and the data required for 
   requests and responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluate whether to use a helper library or work with 
   <a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">Requests</a>. Helper libraries 
   are usually easier to get started with while Requests gives you more 
   control over the HTTP calls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move your API calls into a <a href="/task-queues.html">task queue</a> so they do not 
   block the HTTP request-response cycle for your web application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>Twilio</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/python/twiml">Twilio</a> is a 
<a href="/application-programming-interfaces.html">web application programming interface (API)</a>
that software developers can use to add communications such as 
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/browser-calls/python/django">phone calling</a>, 
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/server-notifications/python/django">messaging</a>, 
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/video/guide/quickstart-js">video</a> and 
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/two-factor-authentication/python/flask">two-factor authentication</a>
into their <a href="/learning-programming.html">Python</a> applications.</p>
<p><img src="/img/logos/twilio.png" width="100%" alt="Twilio logo." class="shot" style="padding: 10px 0 10px 0;"/></p>
<h2>Why is Twilio a good API choice?</h2>
<p>Interacting with the standard telephone networks to send and receive
phone calls and text messages without Twilio is extremely difficult 
if you do not know the unique telecommunications protocols such as 
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Twilio's API abstracts the 
telecommunications pieces so as a developer you can simply use your 
favorite programming languages and frameworks in your application.
For example, here's how you can send an 
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/quickstart/python/sms/sending-via-rest">outbound SMS</a> 
using a few lines of Python code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># import the Twilio helper library (installed with pip install twilio)</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">twilio.rest</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">TwilioRestClient</span>

<span class="c1"># replace the placeholder strings in the following code line with </span>
<span class="c1"># your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token from the Twilio Console</span>
<span class="n">client</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">TwilioRestClient</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;zzzzzzzzzzzzz&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># change the &quot;from_&quot; number to your Twilio number and the &quot;to&quot; number</span>
<span class="c1"># to any phone number you want to send the message to </span>
<span class="n">client</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">messages</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">to</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;+19732644152&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">from_</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;+12023358536&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> 
                       <span class="n">body</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello from Python!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<h2>Web security learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Read and understand the major web application security flaws that are
   commonly exploited by malicious actors. These include cross-site request 
   forgery (CSRF), cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection and session 
   hijacking. The 
   <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10">OWASP top 10 web application vulnerabilities list</a> 
   is a great place to get an overview of these topics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine how the framework you've chosen mitigates these vulnerabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure your code implements the mitigation techniques for your framework. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think like an attacker and actively work to break into your own system. 
   If you do not have enough experience to confidently break the security 
   consider hiring a known white hat attacker. Have her break the 
   application's security, report the easiest vulnerabilities to exploit in 
   your app and help implement protections against those weaknesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognize that no system is ever totally secure. However, the more popular
   an application becomes the more attractive a target it is to attackers.
   Reevaluate your web application security on a frequent basis.</p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>SQL Injection</h1>
<p>SQL injections are a category of web application security vulnerabilities that 
can affect both <a href="/databases.html">relational databases</a> and 
<a href="/no-sql-datastore.html">NoSQL data stores</a>.</p>
<h3>SQL Injection resources</h3>

  Request Forgery issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
   <h1>Deployment</h1>
<p>Deployment involves packaging up your web application and putting it in a 
production environment that can run the app.</p>
<h2>Why is deployment necessary?</h2>
<p>Your web application must live somewhere other than your own desktop or 
laptop. A production environment is the canonical version of your current 
application and its associated data.</p>
<h2>Deployment topics map</h2>
<p>Python web application deployments are comprised of many pieces that need to
be individually configured. Here is a map that visually depicts how each
deployment topic relates to each other. Click the image to pull up a PDF 
version.</p>
<p><a href="/full-stack-python-map.pdf" style="border:none"><img src="/img/visuals/full-stack-python-map.png" width="100%" alt="Full Stack Python deployments map." class="shot"></a></p>
<h2>Deployment hosting options</h2>
<p>There are four options for deploying and hosting a web application:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="/servers.html">"Bare metal" servers</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/servers.html">Virtualized servers</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/servers.html">Infrastructure-as-a-service</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/platform-as-a-service.html">Platform-as-a-service</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first three options are similar. The deployer needs to provision one or
more servers with a Linux distribution. System packages, a web server, 
WSGI server, database and the Python environment are then installed. Finally
the application can be pulled from source and installed in the environment.</p>
<p>Note that there are other ways of installing a Python web application through
system-specific package management systems. We won't cover those in this
guide as they are considered advanced deployment techniques.</p>

<h2>Deployment learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you're tight on time look at the 
   <a href="/platform-as-a-service.html">platform-as-a-service (PaaS)</a> options. You 
   can deploy a low traffic project web app for free or low cost. You won't 
   have to worry about setting up the operating system and web server 
   compared to going the traditional server route. In theory you should be 
   able to get your application live on the web sooner with PaaS hosting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/servers.html">Traditional server options</a> are your best bet for learning
   how the entire Python web stack works. You'll often save money with a 
   virtual private server instead of a platform-as-a-service as you scale up.</p>

  compares and contrasts the cheapest options for four popular virtual 
  private server providers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
   <h1>Servers</h1>
<p>Servers are the physical infrastructure to run all the layers of software
so your web application can respond to requests from clients such as web 
browsers.</p>
<h2>Why are servers necessary?</h2>
<p>Your web application must live somewhere other than your own desktop or 
laptop. Servers should ideally be accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 
with no unplanned downtime. The servers that host your web application for
actual users (as opposed to test users) are known as <em>production</em> servers.
Production servers hold real data (again as opposed to test data) and must be 
secure against unauthorized access.</p>
<h2>Bare metal servers</h2>
<p>The term <em>bare metal</em> refers to purchasing the actual hardware and hooking 
it up to the Internet either through a business-class internet service 
provider (ISP) or 
<a href="http://webdesign.about.com/od/colocation/a/what_colocation.htm">co-locating the server</a>
with other servers. A "business-class" ISP is necessary because
most residential Internet service agreements explicitly prohibit running
web servers on their networks. You may be able to get away with low traffic
volume but if your site serves a lot of traffic it will alert an ISP's
filters.</p>
<p>The bare metal option offers the most control over the server configuration,
usually has the highest performance for the price, but also is the most
expensive upfront option and the highest ongoing maintenance. With bare
metal servers the ongoing operating cost is the electricity the server(s)
use as well as handling repairs when server components malfunction. You're
taking on manual labor working with hardware as well as the rest of the
software stack.</p>
<p>Buy actual hardware from a vendor either pre-built or as a collection of 
components that you assemble yourself. You can also buy 
pre-configured servers from Dell or HP. Those servers tend to be in
smaller case form factors (called "blades") but are correspondingly more 
expensive than putting off-the-shelf components together yourself in a 
standard computer case.</p>
<h2>Virtualized servers</h2>
<p>Virtual private servers (VPSs) are slices of hardware on top of a larger
bare metal server. Virtualization software such as 
<a href="http://www.xen.org/">Xen</a> and
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/virtualization/what-is-virtualization.html">VMWare</a>
allow providers such as <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> and
<a href="http://prgmr.com/xen/">prgmr</a> (as well as a many others) to provide
fractions of a full server that appear as their own instances. For example,
a server with an 8-core Xeon processor and 16 gigabytes of memory can be
sliced into 8 pieces with the equivalent of 1-core and 2 gigabytes of
memory.</p>
<p>The primary disadvantage of virtualized servers is that there is resource
overhead in the virtualization process. In addition, physical constraints
such as heavy I/O operations by a single virtualized instance on persistent 
storage can cause performance bottlenecks for other virtualized instances on
the shared server. Choosing virtualized server hosting should be based on
your needs for urgency of service ticket requests and the frequency you
require for ongoing maintenance such as persistent storage backups.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Infrastructure-as-a-service</h2>
<p>Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) overlaps with virtualized servers 
because the resources are often presented in the same way. The 
difference between virtualized servers and IaaS is the granularity of the
billing cycle. IaaS generally encourages a finer granularity based on minutes
or hours of server usage instead of on monthly billing cycles.</p>
<p>IaaS can be used in combination with virtualized servers to provide 
dynamic upscaling for heavy traffic. When traffic is low then virtualized
servers can solely be used. This combination of resources reduces cost at
the expense of greater complexity in the dynamically scaled infrastructure. </p>
<p>The most common IaaS platforms are 
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> and 
<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/">Rackspace Cloud</a>.</p>
<p>The disadvantage to IaaS platforms is the lock-in if you have to write
custom code to deploy, dynamically scale, and generally understand your
infrastructure. Every platform has its quirks. For example, 
Amazon's standard <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ebs/">Elastic Block Store</a> storage
infrastructure has at least an order of magnitude worse I/O throughput 
than working with your local disk. Your application's database queries may 
work great locally but then when you deploy the performance is inadequate.
Amazon has <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/07/31/announcing-provisioned-iops-for-amazon-ebs/">higher throughput EBS instances</a>
but you will pay correspondingly more for them. EBS throughput is just 
one of many quirks you need to understand before committing to an 
IaaS platform.</p>

<h2>Servers learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sign up for a hosting provider. I recommend getting a 
   <a href="https://www.linode.com/?r=bfeecaf55a83cd3dd224a5f2a3a001fdf95d4c3d">Linode VPS</a> 
   to set up your initial infrastructure and deploy your web application 
   there. <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> and 
   <a href="http://prgmr.com/xen/">prgrmr</a> are other VPS options. You can change
   hosting providers later after the deployment process is automated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provision your first server. It will be ready but in a shutdown state 
   while awaiting your instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move to the <a href="/operating-systems.html">operating systems</a> section to learn
   how to load Ubuntu 14.04 LTS as a base OS for Python web applications.</p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>Static content</h1>
<p>Some content on a website does not change and therefore should be served
up either directly through the web server or a content delivery network (CDN).
Examples include JavaScript, image, and CSS files.</p>
<h2>Types of static content</h2>
<p>Static content can be either assets created as part of your development
process such as images on your landing page or user-generated content. The 
Django framework calls these two categories <em>assets</em> and <em>media</em>.</p>
<h2>Content delivery networks</h2>
<p>A content delivery network (CDN) is a third party that stores and serves 
static files. <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Amazon CloudFront</a>,
<a href="http://www.akamai.com/">Akamai</a>, and 
<a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public/files/">Rackspace Cloud Files</a> 
are examples of CDNs. The purpose of a CDN is to remove the load of static
file requests from web servers that are handling dynamic web content. For
example, if you have an nginx server that handles both static files and 
acts as a front for a Green Unicorn WSGI server on a 512 megabyte 
virtual private server, the nginx server will run into resource 
constraints under heavy traffic. A CDN can remove the need to serve static
assets from that nginx server so it can purely act as a pass through for 
requests to the Green Unicorn WSGI server.</p>
<p>CDNs send content responses from data centers with the closest proximity to the requester.</p>

<h2>Static content learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify a content delivery network to offload serving static content 
   files from your local web server. I recommend using Amazon S3 with 
   CloudFront as it's easy to set up and will scale to high bandwidth demands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update your web application deployment process so updated static files are
   uploaded to the CDN. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move static content serving from the www subdomain to a static (or 
   similarly named) subdomain so browsers will load static content in 
   parallel to www HTTP requests.</p>

   <h1>Virtual private servers (VPS)</h1>
<p>Virtual private servers (VPSs) are sandboxed slices of hardware run with a
hypervisor running on top of a physical server. Virtualization software 
such as <a href="http://www.xenproject.org/">Xen</a> and 
<a href="http://www.vmware.com/virtualization">VMWare</a> allow a providers' 
customers to use fractions of a full server that appear as their own 
independent instances. For example, a server with an 8-core processor 
and 16 gigabytes of memory can be roughly virtualized into 8 pieces with 
the equivalent of 1-core and 2 gigabytes of memory.</p>
<p>The primary disadvantage of virtualized servers is that there is resource 
overhead in the virtualization process. But for our web application 
deployment, a single well-configured virtual private server provides 
more than enough performance and represents a huge cost savings over 
purchasing dedicated hardware. </p>
<h3>VPS providers</h3>
<p>There are many VPS providers and their cost ranges dramatically based on
reliability, support, security and uptime. Make sure to choose a provider
that has a solid reputation unless you are willing to rebuild your server
on another provider whenever issues hit your service. </p>
<p>A few providers I currently use to host my Python web applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a></p>
</li>
<li>

<p><a href="https://amazonlightsail.com/">Amazon Web Services' Lightsail</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
   <h1>Linode</h1>
<p>Linode is a virtual private server service provider that is frequently 
used for deploying production Python web applications.</p>
<h3>Linode resources</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mereommig.dk/en/blog/how-i-survived-going-viral-on-a-5-linode">How I survived going viral on a $5 Linode</a>
  shows the traffic behind a high-trafficked site that runs on an
  inexpensive Linode virtual private server. The author explains that
  because the site was a single-page application with minimal JSON
  server requests it was able to easily withstand the load from hundreds
  of concurrent connections.</li>
</ul>
   <h1>DigitalOcean</h1>
<p>DigitalOcean is a virtual private server provider and deployment 
platform that can be used for running Python applications.</p>
   <h1>Lightsail</h1>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/">Lightsail</a> is Amazon Web Services' 
virtual private server service that can be used for running production 
Python applications.</p>
   <h1>Platform-as-a-service</h1>
<p>A platform-as-a-service (PaaS) provides infrastructure and a software layer
on which a web application is deployed. Running your web application from
a PaaS removes the need to know as much about the underlying servers, 
operating system, web server, and often the WSGI server. </p>
<p><em>Note</em>: If you are not interested in deploying to a PaaS you can move 
ahead to the <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI servers</a> section.</p>
<p>The PaaS layer defines how the application accesses resources such as 
computing time, files, and external services. The PaaS provides a 
higher-level abstraction for working with computing resources than deploying 
an application to a server or IaaS.</p>
<p>A PaaS makes deployment and operations easier because it forces the developer
to conform applications to the PaaS architecture. For example, Heroku looks 
for Python's <code>requirements.txt</code> file in the base directory of the repository 
during deployment because that is the file's de facto community standard
location.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/servers-versus-paas.png" width="100%" alt="Traditional LAMP server stack versus a Platform-as-a-Service stack" class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>If you go the PaaS route, you can skip configuring an operating system
and web server prebaked into PaaS offerings. PaaS offerings generally start 
at the WSGI server layer. </p>
<h2>Platform-as-a-service responsibilities</h2>
<p>Although PaaS offerings simplify setting up and maintaining the servers,
operating system, and web server, developers still have responsibilities for other
layers of their web stack.</p>
<p>While it's useful to know the operating system that underpins your PaaS, for 
example Heroku uses Ubuntu 10.04, you will not have to know as much about 
securing the operating system and server level. However, web applications deployed
to a PaaS are just as vulnerable to security breaches at the application level
as a standard LAMP stack. It's still your responsibility to ensure the web
application framework and your app itself is up to date and secured. See the
<a href="/web-application-security.html">security section</a> for further information.</p>

<h2>Platform-as-a-service learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Review the potential Python platform-as-a-service options listed above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sign up for a PaaS account at the provider that appears to best fit your
   application needs. Heroku is the PaaS option recommended for starters due 
   to their detailed documentation and walkthroughs available on the web. 
   However, the other options are also viable since their purpose is to make 
   deploying applications as easy as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check if there are any PaaS-specific configuration files needed for your 
   app to run properly on the PaaS after it is deployed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deploy your app to the PaaS. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sync your application's configuration with the database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up a content delivery network for your application's 
   <a href="/static-content.html">static content</a> unless your PaaS provider already
   handles this deployment step for you.</p>
</li>

   <h1>Operating Systems</h1>
<p>An operating system runs on the server or virtual server and controls access 
to computing resources. The operating system also includes a way to install
programs necessary for running your Python web application.</p>
<p><img src="/img/logos/operating-systems.jpg" width="100%" alt="Windows, Linux and Apple logos, copyright their respective owners." class="shot rnd outl"></p>
<h2>Why are operating systems necessary?</h2>
<p>An operating system makes many of the computing tasks we take for granted 
easy. For example, the operating system enables writing to files, 
communicating over a network and running multiple programs at once. 
Otherwise you'd need to control the CPU, memory, network, graphics card, 
and many other components with your own low-level implementation.</p>
<p>Without using an existing operating system like Linux, Mac OS X or Windows,
you'd be forced to write a new operating system as part of your web 
application.  It would be impossible to write features for your Python 
web application because you'd be too busy hunting down a memory leak in 
your assembly code, if you even were able to get that far.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the open source community provides Linux to the Python world 
as a rock solid free operating system for running our applications.</p>
<h2>Recommended operating systems</h2>
<p>The only recommended operating systems for production Python web stack 
deployments are 
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">Linux</a>
and 
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>. 
There are several Linux distributions commonly used 
for running production servers. Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) releases, 
Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and CentOS are all viable options. </p>
<p>Mac OS X is fine for development activities. Windows and Mac 
OS X are not appropriate for production deployments unless there is a 
major reason why you must use them in lieu of Linux.</p>
<h3>Canonical's Ubuntu Linux</h3>
<p>Ubuntu is a Linux distribution packaged by the 
<a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical Ltd</a> company. Ubuntu uses the
Debian distribution as a base for packages, including the 
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Apt">aptitude package manager</a>. For desktop versions
of Ubuntu, GNOME (until the 11.04 release, then again in 18.04) or Unity 
(11.10 until 17.10) is bundled with the distribution to provide a user 
interface.</p>
<p>Ubuntu <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS">Long Term Support</a> (LTS) releases
are the recommended versions to use for deployments. LTS versions receive
five years of post-release updates from Canonical. Every two years, Canonical 
creates a new LTS release, which allows for an easy upgrade path as well 
as flexibility in skipping every other LTS release if necessary. As of
May 2018, 
<a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/">18.04 Bionic Beaver</a>
is the latest Ubuntu LTS release. Xenial Xerus includes 
<a href="/python-2-or-3.html">Python 3.6</a> as its default Python version, which is
a major update compared with 2.7 in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and a solid
improvement over Python 3.5 included in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.</p>
<h3>Red Hat and CentOS</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux/">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>
(RHEL) and <a href="http://www.centos.org/">Community ENTerprise Operating System</a>
(CentOS) are the same distribution. The primary difference between the two 
is that CentOS is an open source, liberally licensed free derivative of RHEL.</p>
<p>RHEL and CentOS use a different package manager and command-line interface 
from Debian-based Linux distributions: RPM Package Manager (RPM) and the 
Yellowdog Updater, Modified (YUM). RPM has a specific .rpm file format
to handle the packaging and installation of libraries and applications. YUM
provides a command-line interface for interacting with the RPM system.</p>

<h3>Choosing an OS resources</h3>
<p>macOS and Linux are generally preferred by Python developers over Windows 
because many Python packages like <a href="http://www.gevent.org/">gevent</a> simply do 
not work on Windows. Others such as <a href="/ansible.html">Ansible</a> cannot be used 
as intended on Windows without major hacks.</p>
<p>The following operating system resources cover perspectives on why developers
chose one operating system over others.</p>

<h3>Operating system learning checklist</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Choose either a Debian-based Linux distribution such as Ubuntu or a 
   Fedora-based distribution like CentOS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harden the security through a few basic steps. Install basic security 
   packages such as 
   <a href="http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">fail2ban</a> and
   <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates">unattended-upgrades</a>.
   Create a new user account with sudo privileges and disable
   root logins. Disable password-only logins and use a public-private keypair 
   instead. Read more about hardening systems in the resources listed below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install Python-specific packages to prepare the environment for running a
   Python application. Which packages you'll need to install depends on the 
   distribution you've selected.</p>

   <h1>Ubuntu</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> is a Debian Linux-based 
<a href="/operating-systems.html">operating system</a> distribution often used for 
<a href="/learning-programming.html">Python development</a> and 
<a href="/deployment.html">web application deployment</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/logos/ubuntu-linux.png" width="100%" alt="Official Ubuntu logo. Copyright Canonical Ltd." class="shot"></a></p>
<h2>Why is Ubuntu important for Python?</h2>
<p>Ubuntu is one of the most commonly used Linux distributions for both local
development and server deployments. Some 
<a href="/platform-as-a-service.html">platforms-as-a-service</a> such as Heroku run 
Ubuntu as the base operating system, so as a Python developer you'll often
have to work with Ubuntu or a similar Debian-based Linux operating system.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Ubuntu is an implementation of the <a href="/operating-systems.html">operating systems</a> concept. Learn more in the <a href="/deployment.html">deployment</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>What does "LTS" mean for Ubuntu?</h2>
<p>Every two years Ubuntu releases a Long-Term Support (LTS) version that
receives five years of updates instead of only two years for non-LTS
releases. However, there are some issues with the current LTS model,
in that you 
<a href="http://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/ubuntu-lts-many-vulnerabilities-despite-long-term-support.385386/">must only use packages from the main repository</a> 
unless you're going to manually handle security updates for non-main
repository system packages.</p>

   <h1>Web servers</h1>
<p>Web servers respond to 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</a> (HTTP)
requests from clients and send back a response containing a status code and
often content such as HTML, XML or JSON as well.</p>
<h2>Why are web servers necessary?</h2>
<p>Web servers are the ying to the web client's yang. The server and client speak
the standardized language of the World Wide Web. This standard language
is why an old Mozilla Netscape browser can still talk to a modern Apache or
Nginx web server, even if it cannot properly render the page design like a 
modern web browser can. </p>
<p>The basic language of the Web with the request and response cycle from 
client to server then server back to client remains the same as it was when
the Web was invented by 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners-Lee</a> at CERN in 1989.
Modern browsers and web servers have simply extended the language of the Web
to incorporate new standards.</p>
<h2>Web server implementations</h2>
<p>The conceptual web server idea can be implemented in various ways. The 
following web server implementations each have varying features, extensions
and configurations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="/apache-http-server.html">Apache HTTP Server</a> has been the most 
  commonly deployed web server on the Internet for 20+ years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/nginx.html">Nginx</a> is the second most commonly used server for the
  top 100,000 websites and often serves as a reverse proxy for 
  <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">Python WSGI servers</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/caddy.html">Caddy</a> is a newcomer to the web server scene
  and is focused on serving the HTTP/2 protocol with HTTPS. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://2ton.com.au/rwasa/">rwasa</a> is a newer web server written
  in Assembly with no external dependencies that tuned to be faster than Nginx.
  The benchmarks are worth taking a look at to see if this server could fit
  your needs if you need the fastest performance trading off for as of yet
  untested web server.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Client requests</h2>
<p>A client that sends a request to a web server is usually a browser such 
as Internet Explorer, Firefox, or Chrome, but it can also be a</p>
<ul>
<li>headless browser, commonly use for testing, such as 
  <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">phantomjs</a></li>
<li>commandline utility, for example <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a>
  and <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a></li>
<li>text-based web browser such as 
  <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</a></li>
<li>web crawler. </li>
</ul>
<p>Web servers process requests from the above clients. The result of the web
server's processing is a 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Response_codes">response code</a>
and commonly a content response. Some status codes, such as 204 (No content) 
and 403 (Forbidden), do not have content responses.</p>
<p>In a simple case, the client will request a static asset such as a picture
or JavaScript file. The file sits on the file system in a location the
web server is authorized to access and the web server sends the file
to the client with a 200 status code. If the client already requested the
file and the file has not changed, the web server will pass back a 304 
"Not modified" response indicating the client already has the latest version
of that file.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/web-browser-server-requests.png" width="100%" class="technical-diagram" alt="Web server and web browser request-response cycle" /></p>
<p>A web server sends files to a web browser based on the web browser's 
request. In the first request, the browser accessed the 
"www.fullstackpython.com"
address and the server responded with the index.html HTML-formatted file. 
That HTML file contained references to other files, such as style.css and 
script.js that the browser then requested from the server.</p>
<p>Sending static assets (such as CSS and JavaScript files) can eat up a 
large amount of bandwidth which is why using a Content Delivery Network 
(CDN) to <a href="/static-content.html">serve static assets</a> is important when 
possible.</p>

<h3>Web servers learning checklist</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Choose a web server. <a href="http://nginx.org/en/">Nginx</a> is often recommended 
   although <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> is also a great choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create an SSL certificate via <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>. 
   You will need SSL for serving HTTPS traffic and preventing myriad 
   security issues that occur with unencrypted user input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configure the web server to serve up static files such as 
   <a href="/cascading-style-sheets.html">CSS</a>, <a href="/javascript.html">JavaScript</a>
   and images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you set up the <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI server</a> you'll need to 
   configure the web server as a pass through for dynamic content.</p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>Apache HTTP Server</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/">Apache HTTP Server</a> is a widely deployed web server
that can be used in combination with a WSGI module, such as mod_wsgi or a
stand-alone <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI server</a> to run Python web applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://httpd.apache.org/" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/logos/apache-http-server.jpg" width="100%" alt="Apache HTTP Server logo." class="technical-diagram"></a></p>
<h2>Why is the Apache HTTP Server important?</h2>
<p>Apache remains the most commonly deployed web server with a reign of
20+ years. Its wide usage contributes to the large number of tutorials
and open source modules created by developers for anyone to use.</p>
<p>Apache's development began in mid-1994 as a fork of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSA_HTTPd">NCSA HTTP Server</a> project.
By early 1996, Apache overtook the previously dominant but suddenly stagnant 
NCSA server as NCSA's progress stalled due to signficantly reduced 
development attention.</p>

   <h1>Nginx</h1>
<p><a href="https://nginx.org/en/">Nginx</a>, pronounced "engine-X", is the 
<a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/cross/web_server/ranking">second most common web server among the top 100,000 websites</a>. Nginx also functions well as a 
reverse proxy to handle requests and pass back responses for Python 
<a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI servers</a> or even other web servers such as Apache.</p>
<p><a href="https://nginx.org/en/" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/logos/nginx.png" width="100%" alt="Official Nginx logo." class="shot"></a></p>
<h2>How is Nginx used in a Python web app deployment?</h2>
<p>Nginx is commonly used as a web server to serve static assets such 
as images, CSS and JavaScript to web browser clients. </p>
<p>Nginx is also typically configured as a reverse proxy, which passes 
appropriate incoming HTTP requests to a <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI server</a>.
The WSGI server produces dynamic content by running Python code. When the 
WSGI server passes its response, which is often in the HTML, JSON or XML 
format, the reverse proxy then responds to the client with that result. </p>
<p>The request and response cycle with a reverse proxy server and the WSGI
server can be seen in the following diagram.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/web-servers-map.png" width="100%" alt="Python web application deployments rely on Nginx either as a web server or reverse proxy for WSGI servers." class="shot" /></p>
<p>Typically the client will not know or need to know that a Python web 
application generated the result. The result could have instead been 
generated by one or more backend systems written in any programming language,
not just Python.</p>
<div class="well see-also">Nginx is an implementation of the <a href="/web-servers.html">web server</a> concept. Learn how these pieces fit together in the <a href="/deployment.html">deployment</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>Should I use Nginx or the Apache HTTP Server?</h2>
<p>Let's be clear about these two "competing" servers: they are both fantastic
open source projects and either will serve your web application deployment 
well. In fact, many of the top global web applications use both servers in
their deployments to function in many steps throughout the HTTP 
request-response cycle.</p>
<p>I personally use Nginx more frequently than Apache because Nginx's 
configuration feel easier to write, with less boilerplate than alternatives.</p>
<p>There's also a bit of laziness in the usage: Nginx works well, it never causes
me problems. So I stick with my battle-tested 
Ansible <a href="/configuration-management.html">configuration management</a> files
that set up Nginx with HTTPS and SSL/TLS certificates </p>
<h2>Securing Nginx</h2>
<p>Nginx's default configuration after a standard installation through a
system package manager or compiling from source is a good base for security.
However, setting up ciphers and redirects can be confusing the first few
times you try it. It's a really good idea to read some of these tutorials
to make sure you are avoiding the most common security errors that plague
HTTP(S) configurations.</p>

<h2>Specific Nginx resources</h2>
<p>Nginx can be used without Python so there are a massive number of fantastic
resources available for installing, configuring and optimizing this 
<a href="/web-servers.html">web server</a> implementation. The following resources are

   <h1>WSGI Servers</h1>
<p>A <a href="http://wsgi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Web Server Gateway Interface</a>
(WSGI) server implements the web server side of the WSGI interface for
running Python web applications. </p>
<h2>Why is WSGI necessary?</h2>
<p>A traditional web server does not understand or have any way to run Python 
applications. In the late 1990s, a developer named Grisha Trubetskoy 
<a href="http://grisha.org/blog/2013/10/25/mod-python-the-long-story/">came up with an Apache module called mod_python</a> 
to execute arbitrary Python code. For several years in the late 1990s 
and early 2000s, Apache configured with mod_python ran most Python web 
applications.</p>
<p>However, mod_python wasn't a standard specification. It was just an 
implementation that allowed Python code to run on a server. As mod_python's 
development stalled and security vulnerabilities were discovered there 
was recognition by the community that a consistent way to execute Python 
code for web applications was needed.</p>
<p>Therefore the Python community came up with WSGI as a standard interface that
modules and containers could implement. WSGI is now the accepted approach 
for running Python web applications.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/wsgi-interface.png" alt="WSGI server invoking a WSGI application." width="100%" class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>As shown in the above diagram, a WSGI server simply invokes a callable object
on the WSGI application as defined by the PEP 3333 standard.</p>
<h2>WSGI's Purpose</h2>
<p>Why use WSGI and not just point a web server directly at an application?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>WSGI gives you flexibility</strong>. Application developers can swap out
  web stack components for others. For example, a developer can switch from 
  Green Unicorn to uWSGI without modifying the application or framework 
  that implements WSGI. 
  From <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/">PEP 3333</a>:</p>
<p>The availability and widespread use of such an API in web servers for 
Python [...] would separate choice of framework from choice of web 
server, freeing users to choose a pairing that suits them, while 
freeing framework and server developers to focus on their preferred 
area of specialization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WSGI servers promote scaling</strong>. Serving thousands of requests for dynamic
  content at once is the domain of WSGI servers, not frameworks.
  WSGI servers handle processing requests from the web server and deciding
  how to communicate those requests to an application framework's process.
  The segregation of responsibilities is important for efficiently scaling 
  web traffic.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/web-browser-server-wsgi.png" alt="WSGI Server - Web server - Browser" width="100%" class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<p>WSGI is by design a simple standard interface for running Python code. As
a web developer you won't need to know much more than</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>what WSGI stands for (Web Server Gateway Inteface)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that a WSGI container is a separate running process that runs on a
  different port than your web server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your web server is configured to pass requests to the WSGI container which
  runs your web application, then pass the response (in the form of HTML)
  back to the requester</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're using a standard web framework such as Django, Flask, or
Bottle, or almost any other current Python framework, you don't need to worry
about how frameworks implement the application side of the WSGI standard.
Likewise, if you're using a standard WSGI container such as Green Unicorn,
uWSGI, mod_wsgi, or gevent, you can get them running without worrying about
how they implement the WSGI standard.</p>
<p>However, knowing the WSGI standard and how these frameworks and containers
implement WSGI should be on your learning checklist though as you become
a more experienced Python web developer.</p>
<h2>Official WSGI specifications</h2>
<p>The WSGI standard v1.0 is specified in
<a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/">PEP 0333</a>. As of September 2010,
WSGI v1.0 is superseded by
<a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/">PEP 3333</a>, which defines the
v1.0.1 WSGI standard. If you're working with Python 2.x and you're compliant
with PEP 0333, then you're also compliant with 3333. The newer version is
simply an update for Python 3 and has instructions for how unicode should
be handled.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/wsgiref.html">wsgiref in Python 2.x</a> and
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/wsgiref.html">wsgiref in Python 3.x</a>
are the reference implementations of the WSGI specification built into
Python's standard library so it can be used to build WSGI servers and
applications.</p>
<h2>Example web server configuration</h2>
<p>A web server's configuration specifies what requests should be passed to
the WSGI server to process. Once a request is processed and generated by the
WSGI server, the response is passed back through the web server and onto
the browser. </p>
<p>For example, this Nginx web server's configuration specifies that
Nginx should handle static assets (such as images, JavaScript, and CSS
files) under the /static directory and pass all other requests to the WSGI
server running on port 8000:</p>

   <h1>Green Unicorn (Gunicorn)</h1>
<p><a href="http://gunicorn.org/">Green Unicorn</a>, commonly shortened to "Gunicorn", 
is a <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) server</a>
implementation that is commonly used to run Python web applications.</p>
<p><a href="http://gunicorn.org/" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/logos/gunicorn.jpg" width="100%" alt="Official Green Unicorn (Gunicorn) logo." class="technical-diagram"></a></p>
<h2>Why is Gunicorn important?</h2>
<p>Gunicorn is one of many WSGI server implementations, but it's particularly
important because it is a stable, commonly-used part of
<a href="/deployment.html">web app deployments</a> that's powered some of the
largest Python-powered web applications in the world, such as 
<a href="http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/13649370142/what-powers-instagram-hundreds-of-instances">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p>Gunicorn implements the 
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/">PEP3333 WSGI server standard specification</a>
so that it can run Python web applications that implement the application
interface. For example, if you write a web application with a 
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">web framework</a> such as <a href="/django.html">Django</a>, 
<a href="/flask.html">Flask</a> or <a href="/bottle.html">Bottle</a>, then your application 
implements the WSGI specification. </p>
<div class="well see-also">Gunicorn is an implementation of the <a href="/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI servers</a> concept. Learn how these pieces fit together in the <a href="/deployment.html">deployment</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>How does Gunicorn know how to run my web app?</h2>
<p>Gunicorn knows how to run a web application based on the hook between the 
WSGI server and the WSGI-compliant web app.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a typical Django web application and how it is run
by Gunicorn. We'll use the 
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/compare-python-web-frameworks/tree/master/django_defaults">django_defaults</a> 
as an example Django project. Within the <a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/compare-python-web-frameworks/tree/master/django_defaults/django_defaults">django_defaults</a> 
project subdirectory, there is a short <a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/compare-python-web-frameworks/blob/master/django_defaults/django_defaults/wsgi.py">wsgi.py</a>
file with the following contents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="sd">WSGI config for django_defaults project.</span>

<span class="sd">It exposes the WSGI callable as a module-level variable named ``application``.</span>

<span class="sd">For more information on this file, see</span>
<span class="sd">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/deployment/wsgi/</span>
<span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>

<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.core.wsgi</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">get_wsgi_application</span>

<span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">environ</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">setdefault</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;django_defaults.settings&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">application</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">get_wsgi_application</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That <code>wsgi.py</code> file was generated by the <code>django-admin.py startproject</code> command
when the Django project was first created. Django exposes an <code>application</code> 
variable via that <code>wsgi.py</code> file so that a WSGI server can use <code>application</code> 
as a hook for running the web app. Here's how the situation looks visually:</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/gunicorn-django-wsgi.png" alt="Gunicorn WSGI server invoking a Django WSGI application." width="100%" class="technical-diagram" /></p>
<h2>What's a "pre-fork" worker model?</h2>
<p>Gunicorn is based on a pre-fork worker model, compared to a worker model
architecture. The pre-work worker model means that a master thread spins up
workers to handle requests but otherwise does not control how those workers
perform the request handling. Each worker is independent of the controller.</p>

   <h1>Continuous Integration</h1>
<p>Continuous integration automates the building, testing and deploying of 
applications. Software projects, whether created by a single individual or 
entire teams, typically use continuous integration as a hub to ensure 
important steps such as unit testing are automated rather than manual 
processes.</p>
<h2>Why is continuous integration important?</h2>
<p>When continuous integration (CI) is established as a step in a software 
project's development process it can dramatically reduce deployment times 
by minimizing steps that require human intervention. The only minor downside 
to using CI is that it takes some initial time by a developer to set up and 
then there is some ongoing maintainence if a project is broken into multiple 
parts, such as going from a monolith architecture to 
<a href="/microservices.html">microservices</a>.</p>
<h2>Automated testing</h2>
<p>Another major advantage with CI is that testing can be an automated step in 
the deployment process. Broken deployments can be prevented by running a 
comprehensive test suite of <a href="/unit-testing.html">unit</a> and 
<a href="/integration-testing.html">integration tests</a> when developers check in code 
to a source code repository. Any bugs accidentally introduced during a 
check-in that are caught by the test suite are reported and prevent the 
deployment from proceeding.</p>
<p>The automated testing on checked in source code can be thought of like the 
bumper guards in bowling that prevent code quality from going too far off 
track. CI combined with unit and integration tests check that any code 
modifications do not break existing tests to ensure the software works as 
intended.</p>
<h2>Continuous integration example</h2>
<p>The following picture represents a high level perspective on how continuous
integration and deployment can work. </p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/continuous-integration.png" width="100%" class="shot" alt="One potential way for continuous integration to work with source control and a deployment environment." /></p>
<p>In the above diagram, when new code is committed to a source repository 
there is a hook that notifies the continuous integration server that new 
code needs to be built (the continuous integration server could also
poll the source code repository if a notification is not possible).</p>
<p>The continuous integration server pulls the code to build and test it. If
all tests pass, the continuous integration server begins the deployment
process. The new code is pulled down to the server where the deployment is
taking place. Finally the deployment process is completed via restarting 
services and related deployment activities.</p>
<p>There are many other ways a continuous integration server and its 
deployments can be structured. The above was just one example of a 
relatively simple setup.</p>
<h2>Open source CI projects</h2>
<p>There are a variety of free and open source continuous integration servers 
that are configurable based on a project's needs. </p>
<p>Note that many of these servers are not written in Python but work 
just fine for Python applications. Polyglot organizations (ones that 
use more than a single language and ecosystem) often use a single CI 
server for all of their  projects regardless of the programming language 
the application was written in.</p>

   <h1>Configuration Management</h1>
<p>Configuration management involves modifying servers from an existing state to 
a desired state and automating how an application is deployed.</p>
<h2>Configuration management tools</h2>
<p>Numerous tools exist to modify server state in a controlled 
way, including <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet">Puppet</a>, 
<a href="http://www.getchef.com/chef/">Chef</a>, 
<a href="http://www.saltstack.com/">SaltStack</a>, and Ansible. Puppet and Chef are
written in Ruby, while SaltStack and Ansible are written in Python.</p>
<h2>Ad hoc tasks</h2>
<p>Configuration management tools such as Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and SaltStack
are not useful for performing ad hoc tasks that require interactive responses.
<a href="http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.8/">Fabric</a> and 
<a href="http://docs.pyinvoke.org/en/latest/">Invoke</a> are used for interactive 
operations, such as querying the database from the Django manage.py shell.</p>

<h2>Application dependencies learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Learn about configuration management in the context of deployment 
   automation and infrastructure-as-code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick a configuration management tool and stick with it. My recommendation 
   is Ansible because it is by far the easiest tool to learn and use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read your configuration management tool's documentation and, when 
   necessary, the source code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automate the configuration management and deployment for your project. 
   Note that this is by far the most time consuming step in this 
   checklist but will pay dividends every time you deploy your project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hook the automated deployment tool into your existing deployment process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>Ansible</h1>
<p><a href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html">Ansible</a> is 
<a href="/configuration-management.html">configuration management tool</a> used for 
<a href="/deployment.html">application deployment</a> and 
<a href="/development-environments.html">environment setup</a>.</p>

<h3>Example Ansible playbooks</h3>
<p>Ansible is far easier to learn when you can read how more full-featured 
playbooks are built using many tasks. An interesting note from my own 
experience is that when you get more experienced using Ansible there are
many shortcuts in the task syntax so you can often make playbooks that have
fewer lines of code than when you were less experienced yet the readability
does not suffer. </p>
<p>Check out some of these example playbooks to learn more about how you may
be able to structure your playbooks:</p>

   <h1>Docker</h1>
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/">Docker</a> 
(<a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">source code for core Docker project</a>)
is an infrastructure management platform for running and deploying software. 
The Docker platform is evolving so an exact definition is currently
a moving target, but the core idea behind Docker is that operating 
system-level containers are used as an abstraction layer on top of regular
servers for deployment and application operations.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/" style="border: none;"><img src="/img/logos/docker-wide.png" width="100%" alt="Official Docker logo. Copyright Docker." class="shot"></a></p>
<h2>Why is Docker important?</h2>
<p>Docker can package up applications along with their necessary operating system
dependencies for easier deployment across environments. In the long run it
has the potential to be the abstraction layer that easily manages containers
running on top of any type of server, regardless of whether that server is
on Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, Linode, Rackspace or elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Python projects within Docker images</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This Docker image contains 
  <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker">a Flask application configured to run with uWSGI and Nginx</a>.
  You can also see the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask/">image on Docker hub</a>.</p>

   <h1>Serverless</h1>
<p>Serverless is a <a href="/deployment.html">deployment</a> architecture where 
<a href="/servers.html">servers</a> are not explicitly provisioned by the deployer. 
Code is instead executed based on developer-defined events that are 
triggered, for example when an HTTP POST request is sent to an 
<a href="/application-programming-interfaces.html">API</a> a new line written to a file.</p>
<h2>How can code be executed "without" servers?</h2>
<p>Servers still exist to execute the code but they are abstracted away from 
the developer and handled by a compute platform such as 
<a href="/aws-lambda.html">Amazon Web Services Lambda</a> or 
<a href="/google-cloud-functions.html">Google Cloud Functions</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/img/visuals/serverless.png" width="100%" alt="Serverless compute spectrum." class="technical-diagram"> </p>
<p>Think about deploying code as a spectrum, where on one side you build your
own server from components, hook it up to the internet with a static IP
address, connect the IP address to DNS and start serving requests. The 
hardware, operating system, web server, WSGI server, etc are all completely 
controlled by you. On the opposite side of the spectrum are serverless 
compute platforms that take Python code and execute it without you ever
touching hardware or even knowing what operating system it runs on. </p>
<p>In between those extremes are levels that remove the need to worry about
hardware (virtual private servers), up through removing concerns about
web servers (platforms-as-a-service). Where you fall on the spectrum for
your deployment will depend on your own situation. Serverless is simply
the newest and most extreme of these deployment models so it is up to you
as to how much complexity you want to take on with the deployment versus
your control over each aspect of the hardware and software.</p>
<h3>Serverless implementations</h3>
<p>Each major cloud vendor has a serverless compute implementation.
These implementations are under significant active developer
and not all of them have Python support.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/aws-lambda.html">AWS Lambda</a> is the current leader among serverless
  compute implementations. It has support for both 
  <a href="/blog/aws-lambda-python-2-7.html">Python 2.7</a> and 
  <a href="/blog/aws-lambda-python-3-6.html">Python 3.6/3.7</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Azure Functions has second-class citizen support for Python. It's
  supposed to be possible but 
  <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script/issues/335">kind of hacky at the moment</a>.
  Polyglot support should be quickly coming to Azure to better
  compete with AWS Lambda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IBM Bluemix OpenWhisk is based on the 
  <a href="https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk">Apache OpenWhisk</a>
  open source project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/google-cloud-functions.html">Google Cloud Functions</a> currently
  only supports JavaScript code execution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Webtask.io also only supports JavaScript but there is a cool
  <em>prototype</em> project named <a href="https://github.com/tehsis/webtask-pytask">webtask-pytask</a> 
  to run Python code in the browser via webtask. This demo is definitely not 
  for production code use but awesome to see what the programming community
  can put together using existing code and services.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Serverless frameworks</h3>
<p>Serverless libraries and frameworks aim to provide reusable code that 
handles common or tedious tasks, similar to how 
<a href="/web-frameworks.html">web frameworks</a> deal with common web development tasks.
Some of these frameworks are built for a single service like AWS Lambda,
while others attempt to make cross-serverless operations more palatable.</p>
<p>Frameworks for building Python-based applications on serverless services 
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://serverless.com/">Serverless</a> (<a href="https://github.com/serverless/serverless">source code</a>), 
  which is a useful but generically-named library that focuses on deployment 
  and operations for serverless applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.zappa.io/">Zappa</a> 
  (<a href="https://github.com/Miserlou/Zappa">source code</a>) 
  provides code and tools to make it much easier to build on AWS Lambda
  and AWS API Gateway than rolling your own on the bare services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://chalice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Chalice</a> 
  (<a href="https://github.com/aws/chalice">source code</a>) is built by the AWS team
  specifically for Python applications.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="http://apex.run/">Apex</a> (<a href="https://github.com/apex/apex">source code</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>General serverless resources</h3>
<p>Serverless concepts and implementations are still in their early
iterations so there are many ideas and good practices yet to be
discovered. These resources are the first attempts at figuring
out how to structure and operate serverless applications.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/118/serverless-software">Serverless software</a>
  covers a range of topics under serverless and how deployments have
  changed as new options such as <a href="/platform-as-a-service.html">PaaS</a>

<h3>Serverless environment comparsions</h3>
<p>The "big 3" serverless platforms, 
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-programming-model.html">AWS Lambda</a>, 
<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-functions-python-support-public-preview-2/">Azure Functions</a>
and 
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/python-runtime">Google Cloud Functions</a>
have varying degrees of support for Python. AWS Lambda has
production-ready support for Python 2 and 3.7, while Azure and Google Cloud
have "beta" support with unclear production-worthiness. The following
resources are some comparison articles to help you in your decision-making
process for which platform to learn.</p>

<h3>Serverless vendor lock-in?</h3>
<p>There is some concern by organizations and developers about vendor lock-in
on serverless platforms. It is unclear if portability is worse for
serverless than other infrastructure-as-a-service pieces, but still worth
thinking about ahead of time. These resources provide additional 
perspectives on lock-in and using multiple cloud providers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blog.symphonia.io/on-serverless-multi-cloud-and-vendor-lock-in-da930b3993f">On Serverless, Multi-Cloud, and Vendor Lock In</a>
  is an opinion piece that for <em>most</em> cases the additional work of
  going multi-cloud is not worth the tradeoffs, therefore at this time
  it's better to go for a single vendor such as AWS or Azure and optimize
  on that platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@PaulDJohnston/why-vendor-lock-in-with-serverless-isnt-what-you-think-it-is-d6be40fa9ca9">Why vendor lock-in with serverless isn’t what you think it is</a>
  recommends using a single vendor for now and stop worrying about 
  hedging your bets because it typically makes your infrastructure 
  significantly more complex.</p>

   <h1>AWS Lambda</h1>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda</a> 
is a compute service that executes arbitrary Python code in response 
to developer-defined AWS events, such as inbound API calls or file 
uploads to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS' Simple Storage Service (S3)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" style="border:none"><img src="/img/logos/aws-lambda.jpg" width="100%" alt="AWS Lambda logo." class="shot outl rnd"></a></p>
<h2>Why is Lambda useful?</h2>
<p>Lambda is often used as a "serverless" compute architecture, which 
allows developers to upload their Python code instead of spinning and
configuring servers, deploying their code and scaling based on traffic. </p>
<div class="well see-also">Lambda is an implementation of the <a href="/serverless.html">serverless</a> concept. Learn how these pieces fit together in the <a href="/deployment.html">deployment</a> chapter or view the <a href="/table-of-contents.html">table of contents</a> for all topics.</div>

<h2>Python on AWS Lambda</h2>
<p>Lambda only had support for JavaScript, specifically Node.JS, when it was 
first released in late 2014. Python 2 developers were welcomed to the 
platform less than a year after its release, in October 2015. Lambda now 
has support for both Python 2.7, 3.6 and 3.7.</p>

   <h1>DevOps</h1>
<p>DevOps is the combination of <a href="/web-development.html">application development</a>
and operations, which minimizes or eliminates the disconnect between 
software developers who build applications and systems administrators 
who keep infrastructure running.</p>
<h2>Why is DevOps important?</h2>
<p>When the Agile methodology is properly used to develop software, a new
bottleneck often appears during the frequent <a href="/deployment.html">deployment</a> 
and operations phases. New updates and fixes are produced so fast in each 
sprint that infrastructure teams can be overwhelmed with deployments and 
push back on the pace of delivery. To alleviate some of these issues, 
application developers are asked to work closely with operations folks to
automate the delivery of code from development to production. </p>
<h2>DevOps tooling resources</h2>
<p>DevOps cannot be performed with tools alone, but having the right tools
to augment the culture and processes is important to successful software
delivery. The following resources discuss both Python-specific and general
tools and services for DevOps environments.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/victorneo/devops-python-tools-to-get-started">DevOps: Python tools to get started</a>
  is a presentation slideshow that explains that while DevOps is a culture, 
  it can be supported by tools such as Fabric, Jenkins, BuildBot and Git
  which when used properly can enable continuous software delivery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For an Atlassian-centric perspective on tooling, take a look at 
  this post on how to
  <a href="http://blogs.atlassian.com/2016/03/how-to-choose-devops-tools/">choose the right DevOps tools</a>
  which is biased towards their tools but still has some good insight
  such as using automated testing to provide immediate awareness of 
  defects that require fixing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>General DevOps resources</h2>
<p>The following resources give advice and approaches for building the right
teams, culture, processes and tools into software development organizations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2015/mar/06/devops-vs-platform-engineering/">DevOps vs. Platform Engineering</a>
  considers DevOps an ad hoc approach to developing software while building
  a platform is a strict contract. I see this as "DevOps is a process", 
  while a "platform is code". Running code is better than any organizational 
  process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The open source 
  <a href="https://response.pagerduty.com/">PagerDuty Incident Response guide</a> is the
  amazing result from their company taking the practices they use to keep
  their services running and putting them out for other developers to consume.
  Highly recommended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://blog.scalyr.com/2016/09/so-youve-been-paged/">So, you've been paged</a>
  provides their development team's "Communicate -&gt; Learn -&gt; Act" structure
  for handling production issues based on lessons learned from their years 
  of experience dealing with incidents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/10/15/operations-for-software-developers-for-beginners/">Operations for software developers for beginners</a>
  gives advice to developers who have never done operations work and
  been on call for outages before in their career. The advantage of DevOps
  is greater ownership for developers who built the applications running
  in production. The disadvantage of course is the greater ownership
  also leads to much greater responsibility when something breaks!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google's 
  <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/book/index.html">Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) book</a>
  is free online and required reading for understanding the practices and
  principles behind keeping the largest websites alive. Note though that
  some of the advice in the book will be considered controversial at more
  stodgy traditional organizations that have done operations differently
  for a long time.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.cio.com/article/3015237/application-development/why-are-we-racing-to-devops.html">Why are we racing to DevOps?</a>
  is a very high level summary of the benefits of DevOps to IT organizations.
  It's not specific to Python and doesn't dive into the details, but it's 
  a decent start for figuring out why IT organizations consider DevOps the
  hot new topic after adopting an Agile development methodology.</p>

  covers Google's take on how Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) fits
  with the DevOps world. Roughly speaking, SRE is more closely aligned with
  metrics and how to operate infrastructure and applications, rather than
  the broader principles embodied by the DevOps philosophy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
   <h1>Monitoring</h1>
<p>Monitoring tools capture, analyze and display information for a web 
application's execution. Every application has issues arise throughout
all levels of the web stack. Monitoring tools provide transparency so
developers and operations teams can respond and fix problems.</p>
<h2>Why is monitoring necessary?</h2>
<p>Capturing and analyzing data about your production environment is critical
to proactively deal with stability, performance, and errors in a web 
application.</p>
<h2>Difference between monitoring and logging</h2>
<p>Monitoring and logging are very similar in their purpose of helping to 
diagnose issues with an application and aid the debugging process. One way
to think about the difference is that logging happens based on explicit events
while monitoring is a passive background collection of data. </p>
<p>For example, when an error occurs, that event is explicitly logged through
code in an exception handler. Meanwhile, a monitoring agent instruments the
code and gathers data not only about the logged exception but also the 
performance of the functions.</p>
<p>This distinction between logging and monitoring is vague and not necessarily
the only way to look at it. Pragmatically, both are useful for maintaining a
production web application.</p>
<h2>Monitoring layers</h2>
<p>There are several important resources to monitor on the operating system 
and network level of a web stack.</p>
<ol>
<li>CPU utilization</li>
<li>Memory utilization</li>
<li>Persistence storage consumed versus free</li>
<li>Network bandwidth and latency</li>
</ol>
<p>Application level monitoring encompasses several aspects. The amount of time
and resources dedicated to each aspect will vary based on whether an 
application is read-heavy, write-heavy, or subject to rapid swings in traffic.</p>
<ol>
<li>Application warnings and errors (500-level HTTP errors)</li>
<li>Application code performance</li>
<li>Template rendering time</li>
<li>Browser rendering time for the application</li>
<li>Database querying performance</li>
</ol>
<h2>Open source monitoring projects</h2>
<p>Error Tracking</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry">Sentry</a> started life as a 
  Python-only monitoring project but can now be used for any programming
  language.</li>
</ul>
<p>Metrics</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd/">statsd</a> is a node.js network daemon that
  listens for metrics and aggregates them for transfer into another service
  such as Graphite.</li>

<li><a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/">Munin</a> is a client plugin-based monitoring 
  system that sends monitoring traffic to the Munin node where the data can
  be analyzed and visualized. Note this project is written in Perl so Perl 5
  must be installed on the node collecting the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>User Monitoring</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://github.hubspot.com/bucky/">Bucky</a> measures the performance of a
  web application from end user's browsers and sends that data back to the
  server for collection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hosted monitoring services</h2>
<p>Hosted monitoring software takes away the burden of deploying and operating
the software yourself. However, hosted monitoring costs (often a significant 
amount of) money and take your application's data out of your hands so
these services are not the right fit for every project.</p>
<p>Error Tracking</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rollbar.com/">Rollbar</a> instruments both the server side and
  client side to capture and report exceptions. The 
  <a href="https://rollbar.com/docs/notifier/pyrollbar/">pyrollbar</a> code library

<h2>Monitoring learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Review the software-as-a-service and open source monitoring tools below. 
   Third party services tend to be easier to set up and host the data for 
   you. Open source projects give you more control but you'll need to have 
   additional servers ready for the monitoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My recommendation is to install <a href="http://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a>'s free 
   option with the trial period to see how it works with your app. It'll give 
   you a good idea of the capabilities for application-level monitoring tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As your app scales take a look at setting up one of the the open source 
   monitoring projects such as StatsD with Graphite. The combination of those
   two projects will give you fine-grained control over the system metrics 
   you're collecting and visualizing.</p>

   <h1>Caching</h1>
<p>Caching can reduce the load on servers by storing the results of common 
operations and serving the precomputed answers to clients. </p>
<p>For example, instead of retrieving data from database tables that rarely 
change, you can store the values in-memory. Retrieving values from an 
in-memory location is far faster than retrieving them from a database (which
stores them on a persistent disk like a hard drive.) When the cached values 
change the system can invalidate the cache and re-retrieve the updated values
for future requests.</p>
<p>A cache can be created for multiple layers of the stack. </p>
<h2>Caching backends</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://memcached.org/">memcached</a> is a common in-memory caching system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> is a key-value in-memory data store that can
  easily be configured for caching with libraries such as 
  <a href="https://github.com/sebleier/django-redis-cache">django-redis-cache</a>
  and the similarly-named, but separate project 
  <a href="https://github.com/niwinz/django-redis">django-redis</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Caching resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://redditblog.com/2017/01/17/caching-at-reddit/">Caching at Reddit</a>
  is a wonderful in-depth post that goes into detail on how they handle
  caching their Python web app for 
  <a href="http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/reddit-stats/">billions of pageviews each month</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"<a href="https://bjornjohansen.no/caching-varnish-or-nginx">Caching: Varnish or Nginx?</a>"
  reviews some considerations such as SSL and SPDY support when choosing
  reverse proxy Nginx or Varnish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://bizcoder.com/caching-is-hard-draw-me-a-picture">Caching is Hard, Draw me a Picture</a>
  has diagrams of how web request caching layers work. The post is relevant
  reading even though the author is describing his Microsoft code as the 
  impetus for writing the content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While caching is a useful technique in many situations, it's important
  to also note that there are 
  <a href="https://msol.io/blog/tech/2015/09/05/youre-probably-wrong-about-caching/">downsides to caching</a>
  that many developers fail to take into consideration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Caching learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Analyze your web application for the slowest parts. It's likely there are
   complex database queries that can be precomputed and stored in an in-memory
   data store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leverage your existing in-memory data store already used for session data
   to cache the results of those complex database queries. A 
   <a href="/task-queues.html">task queue</a> can often be used to precompute the results 
   on a regular basis and save them in the data store.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incorporate a cache invalidation scheme so the precomputed results remain 
   accurate when served up to the user.</p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>Logging</h1>
<p>Logging saves output such as errors, warnings and event information to 
persistent storage for debugging purposes. </p>
<h2>Why is logging important?</h2>
<p>Runtime exceptions that prevent code from running are important to log to 
investigate and fix the source of the problems. Informational and debugging 
logging also helps to understand how the application is performing even if 
code is working as intended.</p>
<h2>Logging levels</h2>
<p>Logging is often grouped into several categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information</li>
<li>Debug</li>
<li>Warning</li>
<li>Error</li>
</ol>
<p>Logging errors that occur while a web framework is running is crucial to
understanding how your application is performing. </p>
<h2>Logging aggregators</h2>
<p>When you are running your application on several servers, it is helpful
to have a monitoring tool called a "logging aggregator". You can configure 
your application to forward your system and application logs to one location 
that provides tools for viewing, searching, and monitoring logging events 
across your cluster. </p>
<p>Another advantage of log aggregation tools is they allow you to set up 
custom alerts and alarms so you can get notified when error rates breach a 
certain threshold.</p>
<h3>Open source log aggregators</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/getsentry/sentry">Sentry</a> started as a Django-only
  exception handling service but now has separate logging clients to cover 
  almost all major languages and frameworks. It still works really well for 
  Python-powered web applications and is often used in conjunction with other 
  monitoring tools. <a href="http://raven.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Raven</a> is open
  source Python client for Sentry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://graylog2.org/">Graylog2</a> provides a central server for log 
  aggregation as well as a GUI for browsing and searching through log events. 
  There are libraries for most major languages, including python. Saves data 
  in Elasticache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://logstash.net/">Logstash</a> Similar to Graylog2, logstash offers 
  features to programmatically configure log data workflows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/facebook/scribe">Scribe</a> A project written by Facebook 
  to aggregate logs. It's designed to run on multiple servers and scale with 
  the rest of your cluster. Uses the Thrift messaging format so it can be 
  used with any language. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hosted logging services</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.loggly.com/">Loggly</a> is a third party cloud based 
  application that aggregates logs. They have instructions for every major 
  language, including python. It includes email alerting on custom searches. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a> offers third party cloud and self 
  hosted solutions for event aggregation. It excels at searching and data 
  mining any text based data. </p>

<h2>Logging learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Read how to integrate logging into your web application framework. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure errors and anomalous results are logged. While these logs can be 
   stored in <a href="/monitoring.html">monitoring</a> solutions, it's best to have your 
   own log storage location to debug issues as they arise to complement other 
   monitoring systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate logging for system events you may need to use for debugging 
   purposes later. For example, you may want to know the return values on 
   functions when they are above a certain threshold. </p>
</li>
</ol>
   <h1>Web analytics</h1>
<p>Web analytics involves collecting, processing, visualizing web data to enable
critical thinking about how users interact with a web application.</p>
<h2>Why is web analytics important?</h2>
<p>User clients, especially web browsers, generate significant data while users
read and interact with webpages. The data provides insight into 
how visitors use the site and why they stay or leave. The key concept to
analytics is <em>learning</em> about your users so you can improve your web 
application to better suit their needs. </p>
<h2>Web analytics concepts</h2>
<p>It's easy to get overwhelmed at both the number of analytics services and
the numerous types of data points collected. Focus on just a handful of
metrics when you're just starting out. As your application scales and you 
understand more about your users add additional analytics services 
to gain further insight into their behavior with advanced visualizations such
as heatmaps and action funnels.</p>
<h3>User funnels</h3>
<p>If your application is
selling a product or service you can ultimately build a 
<a href="http://moz.com/blog/building-your-marketing-funnel-with-google-analytics">user funnel</a> (often called "sales funnel" prior to a user becoming a customer)
to better understand why people buy or don't buy what you're selling. With
a funnel you can visualize drop-off points where visitors leave your 
application before taking some action, such as purchasing your service.</p>
<h2>Open source web analytics projects</h2>

  self-hosted platform that integrates through a JavaScript snippet that
  tracks users' interactions with the webpage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hosted web analytics services</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> is a widely used
  free analytics tool for website traffic.</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web analytics learning checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add Google Analytics or Piwik to your application. Both are free and while 
   Piwik is not as powerful as Google Analytics you can self-host the 
   application which is the only option in many environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think critically about the factors that will make your application 
   successful. These factors will vary based on whether it's an internal 
   <a href="/enterprise-python.html">enterprise</a> app, an e-commerce site or an 
   information-based application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add metrics generated from your web traffic based on the factors that 
   drive your application's success. You can add these metrics with either 
   some custom code or with a hosted web analytics service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuously reevaluate whether the metrics you've chosen are still the 
   appropriate ones defining your application's success. Improve and refine 
   the metrics generated by the web analytics as necessary.</p>
</li>
</ol>

   <h1>What "full stack" means</h1>
<p>The terms "full stack" and "Full Stack Python" are ambiguous but I am using
a specific definition here on this site. These term can be defined for a 
web stack either to mean</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Every layer, from the machine code up to the browser, are written in Python </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Python code interacts with code written in other languages such as C and
   JavaScript to provide a complete web stack</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I named this site specifically for the second definition: Python is one
programming language among many that are used to build your application 
stack. </p>
<p>Some folks took the title of the site to mean Python runs everything from 
the web browser on down. That's simply not practical or possible. While Python 
is an amazing programming language, there are many tasks it does not do well.</p>
<p>Python is just one language among many that allows our computers to execute 
software and communicate with each other. </p>
<p>For beginners, learning the syntax and libraries in Python necessary to 
build a web application or web API is a major undertaking. Even intermediate 
and advanced Python software developers need to constantly program and learn 
to keep up with our ever evolving ecosystem. I created Full Stack Python to
be just one of <a href="/best-python-resources.html">many resources</a> that help Python 
developers build and maintain their programming skills.</p>

   <h1>Future Directions</h1>
<p>Full Stack Python has completely blown away my expectations for what I could
accomplish with a side project. I really appreciate all of the in-person 
feedback, emails and pull requests I've received from the community. Keep 
them coming!</p>
<p>For 2017 I am filling in the grayed-out topics on the 
<a href="/table-of-contents.html">all topics</a> page. I will also address the
tactical fixes and improvements that need to be made which are listed
in the "tactical improvements" section below.</p>
<h2>More updates</h2>
<p>A huge update was released in the form of the
<a href="http://www.deploypython.com/">The Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments</a>,
a step-by-step tutorial book for learning how to deploy Python web 
applications.</p>
<p>I also worked with Michael Kennedy of 
<a href="https://talkpython.fm">Talk Python to Me</a> on our 
<a href="https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/explore_entrepreneurs/python-for-entrepreneurs-build-and-launch-your-online-business">Python for Entrepreneurs</a>
video course. It's fully released right now!</p>
<h2>Pull requests and fixes</h2>
<p>Note that these plans can change based on 
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/pulls">pull requests</a>
from the community. I work to integrate PRs within a day or two so please 
submit one when you see a fix or improvement that needs to be made!</p>
<p>Typos, inaccurate statements or general areas for improvement can also 
be handled through an issue ticket or pull request on
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/fullstackpython.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2>Page maturity</h2>
<p>There are so many pages on Full Stack Python (as shown on the
<a href="/table-of-contents.html">all topics / table of contents page</a>)
that many are still in active development.</p>
<p>There are roughly one of four buckets of "maturity" a page could fall into:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not yet created: some pages do not have a detailed page although
   they will have one in the future. These pages are grayed out on
   the table of contents.</li>
<li>Starter: a bare bones explanation with a few resources. For example,
   <a href="/jupyter-notebook.html">Jupyter Notebook</a> and 
   <a href="/sublime-text.html">Sublime Text</a>.</li>
<li>Intermediate: a page has explanations, more details on why it is 
   important along with additional context in multiple sections. Resources
   are well-curated and each link is described in further detail.
   Examples: <a href="/jinja2.html">Jinja2</a> and 
   <a href="/development-environments.html">development environments</a>.</li>
<li>Stellar: a shining example of a well-written, detailed page that 
   contains numerous explanations and descriptions for the topic. 
   Where applicable there should be digrams and visualizations that augment
   the text to help the reader better understand the topic.
   There are also typically multiple categories of resources and links
   for further research.
   Examples: 
   <a href="/object-relational-mappers-orms.html">Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs)</a>,
   <a href="/postgresql.html">PostgreSQL</a> and 
   <a href="/static-site-generator.html">static site generators</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tactical improvements</h2>
<p>Every page on Full Stack Python is a work-in-progress that can always
use improvements. The following items on this list need some love and 
attention.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Update newer pages such as <a href="/aws-lambda.html">AWS Lambda</a>, 
  <a href="/text-editors-ides.html">Text editors and IDEs</a> and
  <a href="/falcon.html">Falcon</a> pages with additional sections and resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/redis-queue-rq.html">RQ</a>: Add "Comparing Celery and RQ" and 
  "when is RQ useful?" sections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/celery.html">Celery</a>: Add graphics to show how Celeryd and Celerybeat
  work. Also add section on comparing Celery to other task queues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/apache-cassandra.html">Apache Cassandra</a>: Add "why use cassandra?"
  and "what is CQL?" sections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/mongodb.html">MongoDB</a>: Add "why is mongodb useful?" and 
  "database drivers" sections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/redis.html">Redis</a>: Add "why use redis?", "data drivers" sections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/git.html">Git</a>: Add "why use git?", "what is a distributed version 
  control system?", "what's the difference between git and github?" and 
  "git clients" sections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
   <h1>Page Statuses</h1>
<p>There are 205 pages on Full Stack Python, not including blog posts. Many 
pages are a work-in-progress. This page aggregates the status of each page 
on the site.</p>
<p>Each page can be in one of four levels of maturity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not yet created</li>
<li>Starter</li>
<li>Intermediate</li>
<li>Maintain</li>
</ol>
<p>Pages are never technically "complete" because there will always be
the possibility of new sections and link maintenance. However, the
aspiration is for all pages to be fully-fleshed out and in the "Maintain"
category where they do not require additional information beyond being
kept up to date with accurate descriptions and resources.</p>
